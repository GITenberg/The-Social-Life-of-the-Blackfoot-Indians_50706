<div><h1 id='ch1'><span class='sc'>Introduction.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In this third paper on the ethnology of the Blackfoot Indians full recognition
should again be given Mr. D. C. Duvall, with whose assistance the
data were collected by the writer on a Museum expedition in 1906. Later,
Mr. Duvall read the descriptive parts of the manuscript to well-informed
Indians, recording their corrections and comments, the substance of which
was incorporated in the final revision. Most of the data come from the
Piegan division in Montana. For supplementary accounts of social customs
the works of Henry, Maximilian, Grinnell, Maclean, and McClintock are
especially worthy of consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since this paper is an integral part of an ethnographic survey in the
Missouri-Saskatchewan area some general statements seem permissible
for there is even yet a deep interest in the order of social grouping in different
parts of the world and its assumed relation with exogamy, to the current
discussion of which our presentation of the Blackfoot band system may
perhaps contribute. We believe the facts indicate these bands to be social
groups, or units, frequently formed and even now taking shape by division,
segregation and union, in the main a physical grouping of individuals in
adjustment to sociological and economic conditions. The readiness with
which a Blackfoot changes his band and the unstable character of the band
name and above all the band’s obvious function as a social and political
unit, make it appear that its somewhat uncertain exogamous character
is a mere coincidence. A satisfactory comparative view of social organization
in this area must await the accumulation of more detailed information
than is now available. A brief résumé may, however, serve to define
some of the problems. Dr. Lowie’s investigation of the Assiniboine reveals
band characteristics similar to those of the Blackfoot in so far as his informants
gave evidence of no precise conscious relation between band affiliation
and restrictions to marriage.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> The Gros Ventre, according to Kroeber,
are composed of bands in which descent is paternal and marriage forbidden
within the bands of one’s father and mother, which has the appearance of a
mere blood restriction.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> The Arapaho bands, on the other hand, were
merely divisions in which membership was inherited but did not affect
marriage in any way.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> The Crow, however, have not only exogamous
bands but phratries. The Teton-Dakota so far as our own information
goes, are like the Assiniboine. For the Western Cree we lack definite
information but such as we have indicates a simple family group and blood
restrictions to marriage. The following statement by Henry may be noted:
“A Cree often finds difficulty in tracing out his grandfather, as they do not
possess totems—that ready expedient among the Saulteurs. They have a
certain way of distinguishing their families and tribes, but it is not nearly
so accurate as that of the Saulteurs, and the second or third generation
back seems often lost in oblivion.”<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> On the west, the Nez Perce seem
innocent of anything like clans or gentes.<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> The Northern Shoshone seem
not to have the formal bands of the Blackfoot and other tribes but to have
recognized simple family groups.<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> The clan-like organizations of the
Ojibway, Winnebago and some other Siouan groups and also the Caddoan
groups on the eastern and southern borders of our area serve to sharpen the
differentiation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The names of Blackfoot bands are not animal terms but characterizations
in no wise different from tribal names. Those of the Assiniboine, Gros
Ventre, Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Teton-Dakota are, so far as reported,
essentially of the same class. It seems then that the name system for these
bands is the same among these neighboring tribes of the area and that it is
an integral part of the whole system of nomenclature for groups of individuals.
This may be of no particular significance, yet it is difficult to see in it
the ear marks of a broken-down clan organization; it looks for all the world
like an economic or physical grouping of a growing population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have seen in the Blackfoot system the suggestion that the band
circle or camp circle organization is in function a political and ceremonial
adjunct and that the exogamous aspects of these bands were accidental.
So far as we know this holds to a degree for other tribes using the band
circle.<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems probable that many discussions of social phenomena could be
expedited if clear distinctions were established between what is conventional
and what is the result of specific functions and adaptations. Unfortunately,
our ignorance of the processes involved and their seeming
illusiveness of apprehension make such a result well-nigh hopeless. By the
large, conventional things, or customs, appear to be products of ideation or
thinking. Now a band circle is clearly a scheme, a conception, that may
well have originated within the mental activities of a single individual, a
true psychic accident. Indeed this is precisely what conventions seem to be—customs,
procedures or orders that happen to become fixed. A band, on
the other hand, is not so easily disposed of. The name itself implies something
instinctive or physical, as a flock, a grove, etc. Something like this
is seen in the ethnic grouping of the Dakota since we have the main group
composed of two large divisions in one of which is the Teton, this again
sub-divided among which we find the Ogalalla, and this in turn divided into
camps, etc. Though detected by conventionalities of language this dividing
and diffusing is largely physical, or at least an organic adjustment to
environment. Then among the Ojibway we have a population widely
scattered in physical groups but over and above all, seemingly independent,
a clan system; the latter is certainly conventional, but the former, not.
Now the Blackfoot band seems in genesis very much of a combined instinctive
and physical grouping, in so far as it is largely a sexual group and
adapted to economic conditions. In its relation to the band system of
government and its exogamous tendency it is clearly conventional. What
may be termed the conventional band system consists in a scheme for the
tribal group designated as a band circle. This scheme once in force would
perpetuate the band names and distinctions in the face of re-groupings for
physical and economic reasons. Something like this has been reported for
the Cheyenne who have practically the same band scheme but live in camps
or physical groups not coincident with the band grouping, hence, their
band was predominatingly conventional. The following statement of
the Arapaho, if we read correctly, is in line with this: “When the bands
were separate, the people in each camped promiscuously and without order.
When the whole tribe was together, it camped in a circle that had an opening
to the east. The members of each band then camped in one place in a
circle.”<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a> All this in turn seems to support the interpretation that the band
circle system is merely a conventionalized scheme of tribal government.
We have noted that among the Blackfoot the tribal governments are so
associated with the band circles that they exist only potentially until the
camps are formed; at other times each band is a law unto itself. So far as
our data go something like this holds in part at least, for the neighboring
tribes. As a hypothesis, then, for further consideration we may state that
the band circles and the bands are the objective forms of a type of tribal
government almost peculiar to this area, an organization of units not to be
confused with the more social clans and gentes of other tribes to which they
bear a superficial resemblance. In closing, we may remark that exogamy
is often but a rule for marriage respecting some conventional groupings.
The Blackfoot appear to have paused at the very threshold of such a ruling
for their bands.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'><span class='sc'>Tribal Divisions.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>As previously stated, there are three political divisions of the Blackfoot
Indians. These were definite when the tribes first came to our knowledge
and their origins have long had a place in mythology. The genesis of these
divisions must forever remain obscure, though there are a few suggestions
as to what may have been the order of differentiation. While the term
Blackfoot has been used by explorers from the very first, it seems also to
have some general significance among the Indians themselves. Thus, a
Piegan will tell you that he is a Piegan, but if asked who are the Piegan,
will usually reply that they are Blackfoot Indians. Naturally, this may be
due to foreign influence, the idea of subordination to the Blackfoot division
having grown out of knowledge that such a classification was accepted by
the dominant race.<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> In the sign language, there appears no distinct designation
for the group as a whole. According to our information the signs
are:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blackfoot. Pass the thumb and extended fingers down the side of the
leg and supplement by pointing to black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blood. Crook the closed fingers and draw across the mouth, the teeth
showing. The idea is that of picking clotted blood from the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Piegan. The closed fist, fingers down, rubbed on the cheek. The
idea is “poorly dressed robes,” the sign signifying the rubbing of a skin.<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a>
One informant claims the name to have been given by the Crow because the
first Piegan they killed wore a scabby robe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the many published stories accounting for the origin of the term
Kainaw<a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[11]</span></sup></a> (Blood) we add the following from the Piegan which is entirely
consistent with the sign. A party of Piegan were found in the mountains
frozen. They lay in a heap. Afterwards, the Blood taunted them by
singing, “All in a pile.” Some time after this, some Blood were found in
the same condition but with dried blood and froth smeared on their faces.
Then the Piegan retorted by singing and making the sign. In daily speech,
the significance of kai seems to be some dried effluvium from the body,
hence, the name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry gives a great deal of information as to the Blackfoot but is not
quite consistent in his classification, for though he recognized the three
historical divisions in his enumeration, he substituted two “bands” for
the Blackfoot;<a id='r12'/><a href='#f12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[12]</span></sup></a> the Cold band and Painted Feather’s band, implying that
these were distinct and strong divisions into which the Blackfoot were
divided. This may have been a temporary segregation under two dominant
leaders. Henry estimated the strength of the Piegan as equal to all the
other divisions combined, an estimate consistent with all our information
and with tradition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are some linguistic differences between the three tribes but these
are chiefly in the choice of words and in current idioms. The Northern
Blackfoot seem to differ more from the Piegan than the latter from the Blood.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch3'><span class='sc'>Courtship.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It seems proper to begin the discussion of our subject with those conventions
directly associated with sexual activities. Among the Blackfoot,
as everywhere, the male is usually the aggressor. He lies in wait outside
the tipi at night or along the paths to the water and wood-gathering places
to force his attentions. This phase of sexual life is often expressed in myths
and tales, intercepting the girl with her bundles of wood being the favorite.<a id='r13'/><a href='#f13' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[13]</span></sup></a>
Another manner of approach is by creeping under the tipi cover into the
sleeping place of the girls. When countenanced by the girl’s family, attentions
may be received by day in full view of all, the couple sitting together
muffled in the same blanket, a familiar Dakota practice. Naturally, the
girl may offer the first invitation. The most conventional way is for her
to make moccasins secretly for the youth of her choice, this being regarded
as the first proper step. Curiously enough, when married the young bride
is expected to make a pair of moccasins for each of her husband’s male
relatives. Then they will say, “Well, my female relative (nĭmps) is all
right, she makes moccasins for us.” As the wife usually goes to live with
her husband’s people, this is something of a formal demonstration of her
worth to his family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To all appearances, at least, virginity is held in very great esteem and
extreme precaution is taken to guard the girls of the family. They are
closely watched by their mothers and married off as soon as possible after
puberty. For a girl to become pregnant is regarded as an extreme family
disgrace. She will be scolded privately; but none of the family will speak
of the matter in public if it can be avoided, they bearing their shame silently.
No special demands are made of the co-partner in her shame, the girl alone
being the one held responsible. Marriage may result, but the initiative is
usually left to the man, since he is not regarded as having erred or fallen
into disfavor. The formal virginity tests and puberty ceremonies practised
among the Siouan tribes seem to have no place in Blackfoot society. The
male lover enjoys unusual liberties. His efforts at debauchery are not only
tolerated but encouraged by his family and should he lead a married woman
astray is heralded as a person of promise. Thus, while great pains are taken
to safeguard young girls, boys are, if anything, encouraged to break through
the barriers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the flageolet is a favorite adjunct of courtship among many
tribes of the area, its use in this connection seems to have been ignored by
the Blackfoot. They did, however, resort to charms and formula known
collectively as Cree medicine, a subject to be discussed in another paper.
From what information we have, the pursuit of the female was much less
in evidence than among the Dakota and other Siouan tribes.<a id='r14'/><a href='#f14' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[14]</span></sup></a> We found
no traces of conventional modes of registering conquests as among the
young men of the Dakota and Village Indians.<a id='r15'/><a href='#f15' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[15]</span></sup></a></p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch4'><span class='sc'>Marriage and Its Obligations.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Before proceeding, it should be noted that the courtship discussed in the
preceding has no necessary relation to marriage, and may continue secretly
after one or both are married. Proposals frequently come from the parents
of either the girl or the man and often without the knowledge of one or
both of the contracting parties. Mr. Grinnell has described in some detail
what may be regarded as the most ostentatious form of proposal,<a id='r16'/><a href='#f16' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[16]</span></sup></a> making
it unnecessary to discuss the matter here. In general, it appears that the
negotiations are carried on between the fathers of the couple or between the
father and his prospective son-in-law. If successful, the next step is the
exchange of presents. Grinnell denies that there is an idea of wife purchase
in these transactions,<a id='r17'/><a href='#f17' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[17]</span></sup></a> but when discussing divorce on the following page
says the husband could “demand the price paid for her.” According to our
information, the idea of purchase is still alive, though the woman herself
may, as Grinnell claims, be regarded as more than a chattel. Even to-day,
the bridegroom is expected to give a few horses and other property to the
bride’s parents, and though presents are often sent with the bride, the
bridegroom must return at least two-fold.<a id='r18'/><a href='#f18' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[18]</span></sup></a> In former times, it is said, well-to-do
families prepared the bride with an outfit of horses, clothing, etc.,
and paraded over toward the band of the bridegroom to be met in turn by a
similar procession and outfit. The chief object here was a parade of wealth,
that all the people might see the social excellence of the two families; for,
as just stated, the bridegroom must in the end pay a price over and above
the mere exchange of presents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Piegan to whom the text was read commented as follows:—They do
pay for their women. When a man punishes his woman, he generally
remarks that he paid enough for her, and, hence, can do with her as he will.
On the other hand, if a man who gives few presents or pays nothing, becomes
exacting, the woman’s relatives will remark that as he paid little or nothing
he should desist; they may even take her away and find another husband
for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a belief that the father-in-law was for a time entitled to part of
the spoils of the chase and war, especially the latter. During the period
between the proposal and the marriage, the hunt was delivered to the tipi
of the prospective father-in-law and when cooked a portion was carried to
the young man’s tipi by the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The formal marriage ceremony was simple, the couple taking their
proper places in the tipi and assuming at once their domestic responsibilities.
The husband was expected to hunt and accumulate horses; the wife
to prepare the food, make the clothing, etc. He had no great obligations
to her in his associations with other women; but she, on the other hand,
must strictly respect her compact. As the hour of marriage approached,
the girl’s relatives gave her a forceful talk on her obligations and the shame
of adultery. Her attention was called to the important part a virtuous
married woman may take in the sun dance as well as her fitness to call upon
the sun for aid in times of trial. She was threatened with death, if she
yielded to temptation. Formerly, it is said, a wife was often executed for
committing adultery. Should the husband fail to do this, her relatives
would often carry it out to save the name of the family. Such executions
are described as having been barbarous beyond belief. Later, the woman’s
nose was cut off; several women now living bear these marks of shame.<a id='r19'/><a href='#f19' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[19]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>If the husband was a head man, he used his own judgment as to the woman’s
guilt and it is believed that the penalty was often due more to his unreasonable
jealousy than to real knowledge of his wife’s guilt. Yet, in any event,
the disgrace and shame for the relatives of both husband and wife was so
great that extreme penalties for mere suspicion were considered justifiable,
if the interested parties were of some importance in social life. Another
form of punishment was for the husband to call on the members of his
society to deal with the woman, whom they debauched in the most shocking
manner and turned out of doors to become a prostitute. Not many years
ago, a young man called in all his friends, and delivered his faithless wife
to them for such treatment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lending of wives was looked upon as a disgrace, or at least as irregular.
A distinction should be made, however, between the favorite wife
and other wives. These others were often captured women from other
tribes, violated by a war party before becoming members of a household.
Such were often loaned by their masters without exciting public dissent.
It may have been such women that came to the notice of Henry and excited
his extreme contempt.<a id='r20'/><a href='#f20' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[20]</span></sup></a></p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch5'><span class='sc'>Plurality of Wives.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There were no restrictions as to the number of women taken to wife,
but no woman could have more than one husband. Economic conditions,
however, were unfavorable to a household of many wives, so that many
men kept but a single wife and very few indeed ventured to support as many
as five. On the other hand, a man of importance was expected to have two
or more wives, suggesting wealth and resourcefulness. Plural wives speak
of themselves as niskas (married to the same man) or, if of considerable
difference in age, as elder and younger sisters. In the normal order of
events, the first wife is the real, or head wife (she who sits beside him).
A man may depose the head wife and confer the right upon another; but
such was regarded as unusual, except where the provocation was great.
When he went upon a journey, the head wife alone usually accompanied
him. In the transfer of medicines, she took the woman’s part and afterwards
cared for the bundle. It seems that in this function, at least, she was
secure from the whims of her husband. Again, there is the belief that the
marriage obligations demanded more of her; the other wives, especially if
young, were generally assumed to have lovers among the young men even
though such was formally forbidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is said, that sometimes the intimate friends of a young man about to
marry would ask for the loan of his wife after marrying, but that in such
cases the wife rarely yielded to his requests as she was always upheld in an
appeal to his or her relatives. In the absence of other data, it is not safe to
consider this a survival of former practices. However, it should be considered
a possible phase of the distant-wife relations.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch6'><span class='sc'>Potential Wives.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The sisters of a wife are spoken of as “distant-wives” and may be, in a
way, potential wives, though it is not clear that there was any obligation
involved when plural marriages were permitted. If a man proved to be a
good husband, it is said, he might be given the “distant-wives” in turn,
but there was no compulsion. The marriage of sisters was justified on
practical grounds, they being more likely to live together in harmony. If
there was a twin brother, the distant-wife relationship applied to him also;
if not an actual twin but an inseparable companion (nitâks ok kowŏmmaul)
the same term would apply, though in these cases to a less degree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is, however, a curious social custom still in force by which a man
and his distant-wives are expected, on meeting, to engage in bold and obscene
jests concerning sexual matters. This is often carried to a degree
beyond belief. Thus, there is not only the same freedom here as between
man and wife, but the conventional necessity for license. As practically
all other relatives by marriage are forbidden the least reference to such
subjects, the force of the exception is greatly magnified. For example,
a man will not even relate the obscene tales of the Old Man and other tales
containing such reference in the presence of his brothers-in-law nor before
their immediate relatives. If we add to this an equal prohibition against
the presence of his sisters and female cousins, we have marked out the
limits of this taboo. Thus, it appears that with respect to this taboo, the
distant-wives are placed in an exaggerated sense in the category of real wives.
Other familiarities of a man with his distant-wives are strictly improper.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch7'><span class='sc'>The Mother-in-Law Taboo.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The preceding may be a phase of the well-known mother-in-law taboo.
Among the Blackfoot, still, a man should not speak to his mother-in-law,
or even look at her. The taboo is equally binding upon her. If one is
discovered about to enter the tipi where the other is present, someone gives
warning in time to avoid the breach. Should the son-in-law enter, he must
make her a present to mitigate her shame; should the mother-in-law offend,
she must also make a small return. However, as usual with such taboos,
there are ways of adjusting this restriction when necessary. If the son-in-law
is ill, she may, in case of need, care for him and speak to him; upon his
recovery the taboo is considered as permanently removed. Each may call
on the other when in great danger, after which they need not be ashamed to
meet. Sometimes when a man went out to war or was missing, his mother-in-law
would register a vow that if he returned alive, she would shake hands
with him and give him a horse and feel no more shame at meeting. The
son-in-law may remove the taboo by presenting a few captured guns or
horses. Some informants claim that four such presentations were necessary,
after which his mother-in-law would take him by the hand and thus remove
the taboo. She may receive support from her son-in-law but, even with the
taboo removed, must not live in the same tipi with him, a small one being
set up outside. It is observable that the presents for removing the taboo
bear some analogy to those made the father-in-law during the first months
of married life and may be genetically related to that practice.<a id='r21'/><a href='#f21' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[21]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The counterpart of this taboo does not prevail, since a man need not
avoid his daughter-in-law, his association with her being governed by the
conventions applying to his own daughters. Yet, it is not looked upon as
quite right for a man to spend too much time at the home of his son. On the
other hand, for a man to live with his father-in-law, or spend a great deal
of his time there, excites ridicule.</p>

from that moment, to converse with him.”—Maximilian, Vol. 23, 283. Among the Assiniboine
the father-in-law taboo may be so removed.—Lowie, (a), 41. For the Cree we may
add:—“Amongst our visitors was the son-in-law of the chief; and, according to Indian
custom, he took his seat with his back towards his father and mother-in-law, never addressing
them but through the medium of a third party, and they preserving the same etiquette
towards him. This rule is not broken through until the son-in-law proves himself worthy of
personally speaking to him, by having killed an enemy with white hairs; they then become
entitled to wear a dress trimmed with human hair, taken from the scalps of their foes.”

and adultery. For these or any other causes he may turn his wife out of
doors. The woman then returns to her relatives where she is cared for and
protected until another marriage can be arranged. The husband usually
demands a return for the property he gave for her at marriage; he is sure
to do this if she marries again. From the woman’s point of view, adultery
does not justify divorce, but neglect and cruelty may result in abandonment.
She flees to her relatives where she is safe from attack. The husband’s
family then opens negotiations with her relatives and an attempt at adjustment
is made. The woman’s family usually agrees to another trial, but
may finally decide to find her another husband. Then her husband demands
a settlement and is entitled to equivalent return for what he gave at marriage.
Thus, formal divorce is really a restitution of the husband’s marriage gifts,
or a refund of the purchase price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In general, divorce seems not to have been common as it was looked upon
as disgraceful under all circumstances and grievously expensive. The
behavior of the husband was softened by his knowing that in case of continued
discord his wife’s relatives were certain to interfere except she were
charged with adultery and even in that event would retaliate if the accusation
was manifestly unjust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the husband dies, the wife usually returns to her relatives who
again arrange for her marriage.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch9'><span class='sc'>Relationship.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The most important relationships in life are given in the accompanying
table where the equivalents in our nomenclature are given for the Piegan
terms: first, if the person considered is male, second, if female. In general,
it appears that the terms as applied by males to males are more restricted
and definite than those of males to females and females to persons of both
sexes, though in function the terms are so used as to be equally intelligible.
Thus, while a girl uses the term, father, in addressing men married to her
mother’s sisters, she does not confuse this relation with the real one. On the
other hand, it appears that the system as given in the table is ordered on the
theory that sisters become the wives of the same man. This is also consistent
with the distant-wife relationship previously discussed. Further, the
system seems adapted to a gentile band organization in that the relationships
of the women are more inclusive on the father’s side; this, however,
is not entirely consistent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a peculiar artificial relationship among boys that deserves
attention. Many of them have a male companion from whom they are
almost inseparable. The pairs are usually of the same age and grow up
together as it were; they play together, they go to war together, they aid
each other in courtship and in after life call on each other for help and advice.
These bonds often last until death.<a id='r22'/><a href='#f22' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[22]</span></sup></a> The terms of relationship for
brothers are sometimes used by them and it is not unusual for them to
assume the equality of twins. Thus, a twin will speak of his brother’s wife
as his distant-wife, a term often used in the same way by men holding
the relation alluded to above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Persons of any age or nationality may be adopted into a family. Formerly
a man losing a son might adopt a young man from his own or other
bands, or even a captive, to fill the vacant place; an old woman might,
on her own initiative, do the same thing. Very often the bosom companion
of the deceased would be recognized as a son by adoption, but without
obliterating his true family ties. In late years, a number of white men
have been adopted as a mark of respect and in all cases of this kind, the
Blackfoot expect the nominal support of a son to his parents. The ceremony
of adoption is not as elaborate and fixed as among the Dakota and
some other Siouan tribes, though a form of this ceremonial relation is used
in the transfer of medicines.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch10'><span class='sc'>Names.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Each individual has a name. The name is single in that there is neither
family nor band name; though some persons, especially men, possess
several names, these are co-ordinate and never used jointly. The right
to name the child rests with the father; though he rarely confers it in person
unless a man of great importance. He usually calls in a man of distinction
who receives presents in return for his services. A woman may be called,
but less often than a man, be the child male or female. There is no fixed
time for this, but it is not considered right to defer it many weeks after birth.
The namer asks to have a sweat house made which he enters, often in company
with the father and other men he chances to invite. After the usual
sweat house ceremonies, the namer suggests two or three names for consideration
by the family. A selection is then made, the father, in any event,
having the right of final approval. Prayers are usually offered by the namer.
The conferring of the name is regarded as of very great importance since
the manner of its doing is believed to influence the fate of the child during
the entire span of life. The virtue of the naming is greatly enhanced, if
the officiating person is one of great renown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name chosen may have various origins. As a rule, it will be the
name of some person long dead, if possible one of great distinction. Thus,
the writer was in a way adopted by a Blood head man, who gave him choice
of two names, one that of a distinguished warrior, the other of a great
medicine man. If a person living is known to bear the preferred name, it
may be slightly modified by the change or addition of attributes. Thus,
Little Dog may become White Dog, or simply Dog, to distinguish the bearer
from another of the same name. In all such cases, there is the feeling that
the name itself carries with it some power to promote the well being of him
upon whom it is conferred. Again, a father may name the child from deeds
of his own, as Two-guns, Takes-the-shield, etc. As a rule, unless he has
weighty deeds to his credit, the father will not himself venture to confer a
name. As always, there is the feeling that unless the name is of great worth,
the fates will be adverse to the named. Sometimes, one may have a dream
or hear a voice that gives him power to confer a name; it goes without saying
that such is considered highly efficacious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mothers usually give the baby a special name according to some characteristic
habit or expression. This name is rarely used by others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women seldom change their names but men always do. When the
youth goes on his first war party his companions give him a new name.
This name often carries with it an element of ridicule and should the youth
show reluctance at its proposal it will be changed to Not-want-to-be-called-etc.
After the party has returned the family will say to the youth, “Well,
I suppose you have a new name: I suppose it is the name of some old grandmother,
etc.” Then the youth is forced to give his new name which is
certain to excite great merriment and teasing. Later, when the youth
performs some worthy deed, he will be given a new and more dignified name.
This will be his name as a man, though subject to change at any time.
Names are sometimes formally changed at the sun dance by the chief-weather-dancer
who announces, “Now, if you wish this man to aid you,
if you call upon him for help, etc., you must address him as ——.
His other name is now left behind at this place.” At other times the change
of names is less formal and may be at the sole initiative of the person concerned.
In practice, it seems that a man never really abandons a name
though always spoken of by the last conferred or current name since he
will say that he has two, three, or any number, as the case may be, enumerating
all those given him during his life. While to ask a man his name is
very rude, he himself seems free to speak of it on his own initiative. The
custom seems to rest upon ideas of politeness, since not to have heard a
man’s name even before meeting him is said to reflect upon his good standing
among the people.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch11'><span class='sc'>Bands.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Each of the three tribes is composed of bands, kaiyok′ kowŏmmostĭijaw,
implying not only bonds of friendship but bonds of blood.<a id='r23'/><a href='#f23' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[23]</span></sup></a> These bands
have been discussed by Grinnell who considers them true gentes<a id='r24'/><a href='#f24' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[24]</span></sup></a> though
he states that in recent times, at least, the adherence to exogamy was not
absolute. For our part, we have met with many contradictory statements
and observations among the Indians now living, so that we can do no more
than offer what seems to be the most consistent view of the data available.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, while the band is a definite group in the minds of the
Indians and every individual knows to what band he belongs, they manifest
uncertainty as to how membership is determined and as to its bearing upon
marriage restrictions. There is, however, no evidence of a belief in a band
ancestor, human or animal; and, hence, no band totem. The name of
the band has no relation to a founder but is supposed to designate, in a way,
some peculiarity common to the groups as a whole. Thus, the names are
in theory and kind the same as tribe names—Blood, Piegan, etc.—originating
normally after the manner of object names in general and apparently
not in conformity to some system or belief concerning descent or relationship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At marriage, the wife goes to her husband and is considered as belonging
to his band. The general feeling seems to be that the children belong to
the band of their father. Should the father die, the mother and children
will go to their relatives best able and willing to care for them, but the
children will always be called after their father’s band. Should the mother’s
relatives in her own band be few and not as able to care for the children as
the father’s people, they remain in the father’s band. These relatives may
live in the same band, but in any event, the mother takes the dependent
children with her. Should she marry in another band, as is frequent, her
children may reside with her in their step-father’s band. There is no rule
governing cases of this sort and it is said that the children usually go to the
band in which they have the strongest ties. Yet, they are seldom really
lost to the sight of the father’s band and are often reminded by them that
they properly belong to their band. Thus, it seems that the bands are in
part, at least, gentes. Yet a man may change his band even in middle life.<a id='r25'/><a href='#f25' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[25]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>For a man to join the band of his wife at marriage is not unusual. The
reasons for such changes are usually selfish, in that greater material and
social advantages are offered, but we have no suggestion of such transfers
being made with the idea of recruiting a depleted band. A man who changes
his band may become a head man or even a chief without hindrance, as in
the case of a well-known Piegan chief now living. Thus, it appears that
there is no absolute rule of descent in band membership and that what
bonds exist are rather those of real blood relationship than of an artificial
system. Further, it appears that continuous residence or association with
a band is practically equivalent to membership therein. The individual
seems free to select his band.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To marry within the band is not good form, but not criminal. Thus,
when a proposal for marriage has been made, the relatives of the girl get
together and have a talk, their first and chief concern being the question
of blood relationship. Naturally, the band affiliations of the contracting
parties cannot be taken as a criterion since both may have very near relatives
in several bands and cousins of the first degree are ineligible. Should
the contracting parties belong to the same band but be otherwise eligible,
the marriage would be confirmed, though with some reluctance, because
there is always a suspicion that some close blood relationship may have been
overlooked. Thus, while this attitude is not quite consistent, it implies
that the fundamental bar to marriage is relation by blood, or true descent,
and that common membership in a band is socially undesirable rather than
prohibitive. If we may now add our own interpretation, we should say
that the close companionship of the members of the band leads to the
feeling that all children are in a sense the children of all the adults and that
all the children are brothers and sisters and to a natural repugnance to
intermarriage. Further, since most of the men in a band are in theory,
of common paternal descent, even the informal adoption of a stranger would
tend to confer upon him the same inheritance which as time dulled the memory
would become more and more of a reality. In any event, the attitude
of the Blackfoot themselves seems to imply that the band system came into
existence after the present marriage customs and adapted itself to them
rather than they to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A woman is called nĭmps by all members of her husband’s band, not his
actual relatives. She may speak of all male members of the band older
than herself as grandfather while the younger males may in turn speak of
her as mother. Sometimes men of the same age as her husband, speak
of her as “distant-wife.” While this may be consistent with a theory
of gentile band organization in opposition to other data secured by us, our
opinion is that it is at least equally probable that these terms were originally
applied as marks of respect and circumstantial association, and consequently
of little value as indicating the genesis of the band relations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We must not permit the question of exogamy to conceal the important
political and social functions of the band system. As one informant says,
“the members always hang together at all times.” In another place, we
have noted how the responsibility for the acts of individuals is charged to
the band as a whole and how all are bound to contribute to the payment
of penalties and even risk life and limb in defense of a member guilty of
murder. In such, we shall doubtless find the true function of the Blackfoot
band. The confusion as to exogamy seems to arise from the fact that
blood ties tend to hold the children to the band of the father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tendency is for each band to live apart. When a band becomes very
weak in numbers or able-bodied men, it takes up its residence beside another
band or scatters out among relatives in various bands, but this is from
necessity rather than choice. At present, the Blackfoot reserves are dotted
here and there by small clusters of cabins, the permanent or at least the
winter homes of the respective bands. By tradition, this was always the
custom, though tipis were used instead of cabins. When two or more bands
choose to occupy immediate parts of the same valley, their camps are segregated
and, if possible, separated by a brook, a point of highland, or other
natural barrier. The scattering of bands during the winter was an economic
necessity, a practice accentuated among the Thick-wood Cree and other
similar tribes. Something was lost in defensive powers but this was doubtless
fully offset by greater immunity from starvation. In summer, the
bands tended to collect and move about, both for trade and for the hunt.
From what information we could secure, this seemed to be a natural congregation
under the leadership of some popular man, usually a head man in
his band. While the tendency was for the bands as a whole to join such
leaders, it often happened that part of a band cast its lot with one group
and part with another; however, such unions were usually temporary,
the whole band being ultimately re-united when the tribe finally came
together, either to trade at a post or to perform a ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grinnell gives a list of the bands which he implies are to be taken as
existing about 1860 and this agrees quite well with the information we
secured. From the foregoing, it is natural to expect changes at any time.
Since the names seem particularistic in their significance, we give only Mr.
Duvall’s translations. For the Blood and North Blackfoot, our list is less
complete.<a id='r26'/><a href='#f26' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[26]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>These lists are doubtless far from being complete. Even among the
Indians themselves confusion seems to exist as to some names since a band
may be known by two or more names. Under these conditions we deemed
the preceding data sufficient to our purpose. Mr. Grinnell explains the
existence of bands of the same name among the various divisions as due to
members of the bands leaving their own tribe to live with another. As we
have no data on this point it must pass, though we see no reason why some
of the band names may not be older than the tribal divisions. On the other
hand, some of the translated names for Gros Ventre bands as stated by
Kroeber are identical in meaning with some of those found among the
several tribal divisions of the Blackfoot. Again, we are not ready to accept
unconditionally the opinion of Grinnell that the disparity between band
ties and blood ties is due to the gradual disintegration of tribal life, having
previously stated our reasons for assuming the system of blood relationship
the older form and pointed out that the band is rather political than otherwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the origin of the term band, used so generally by the older writers and traders
of this area, we have a suggestion from Keating: “The term <span class='it'>band</span>, as applied to a herd of
buffalo, has almost become technical, being the only one in use in the west. It is derived from
the French term <span class='it'>bande</span>.” Keating, 379. We may venture that the use of this term for a head
man and his following among the Indians of this same area was suggested by the analogy
between the two kinds of groups, these old naïve observers not being blinded by sociological
preconceptions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this point, the following statement of a Piegan informant may be worthy of note:
A man may go into another band and live there if he choose, nothing much being said about
it. Sometimes a man may not like the chief of his own band and so go to another. There
is neither announcement nor formal adoption, he simply goes there to live. For a time, it
may be thrown out to him that he belongs elsewhere but after a while he is always spoken of
as a member. When a band begins, it may be a group of two or three brothers, fathers, and
grandfather, or a small family band (which means the same thing); later, friends or admirers
of the head man in this family may join them until the band becomes very large. Bands may
split in dissention, one part joining another or forming a new one. A new group is soon given
a name by other people according to some habit or peculiarity. They do not name themselves.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch12'><span class='sc'>The Camp Circle.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>As among many tribes, there was a definite order of camping when the
circle of tipis was formed. While Mooney may be correct in his claim that
the circle of the Cheyenne is their fundamental social organization, it cannot
be said that the circle of the Blackfoot holds a very close objective
relation to their organization. In the first place, each division (Blackfoot,
Blood and Piegan) had its own circle and there are no traditions that they
were ever combined. When a circle is formed, all visitors from other
divisions must, like those from strange tribes, camp outside and apart.
Further, there is a firm belief among the Piegan that the circle was never
formed except for the sun dance and certain related ceremonies connected
with the beaver medicine. It seems likely that if the circle were fundamental
and not of recent origin, there would be traces of a parent circle and
vestiges of rules governing its formation. Further, as among the Cheyenne,
there is no great unanimity of opinion as to the order of the various bands
in the circle but at the sun dance the leading men decide arbitrarily any
doubt that may exist as to the place of a particular band. The further
discussion of this point may be deferred until we take up the sun dance
and its problems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opening in the circle is to the east and the order of bands is enumerated
from the south side of the opening, as in the characteristic ceremonial
order of movement. The present order for the Piegan is as given in the list.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch13'><span class='sc'>Tribal Organization and Control.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In a way, the band may be considered the social and political unit.
There is, in a general sense, a band chief, but we have failed to find good
grounds for assuming that he has any formal right to a title or an office.
He is one of an indefinite number of men designated as head men. These
head men may be considered as the social aristocracy, holding their place
in society in the same indefinite and uncertain manner as the social leaders
of our own communities. Thus, we hear that no Blackfoot can aspire to be
looked upon as a head man unless he is able to entertain well, often invite
others to his board, and make a practice of relieving the wants of his less
fortunate band members. Such practices are sure to strain the aspirant’s
resources and many sink under it; but he who can meet all such demands
soon acquires a place in the social life of the band that is often proof against
the ill fortunes of later years. This phase of their social life is very much
alive, having survived not only the changes in economic conditions brought
about by the reservation system but the direct opposition of its officers.
This story is oft repeated: a young man takes to stock raising, accumulates
cattle and horses, gradually taking into nominal employ all his less able
relatives who thus come to depend upon him. Presently, he wakes up to the
situation and entertains an ambition to become the leading head man of
his band, or even of all bands. Then begins a campaign. He makes
feasts, gives presents, buys medicines, and supports ceremonies; thus
making his home the center of social and ceremonial activities, the leadership
of which he assumes. His rivals are stirred to activity also and the
contest goes on apace. From observation, we believe that bankruptcy
is the usual result; but, unless this comes at the very beginning of the effort,
the aspirant acquires enough prestige to give him some claim to being a
head man for the rest of his days even though he becomes a hanger-on at
the door of a younger aspirant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the head men are those who are or have been social leaders.
Naturally, individual worth counts in such contests and he who is born
to lead will both in matters great and small. In former times, these rivalries
often led to assassination and other dark deeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the reservation system came in, deeds of the warpath were also
essential to the production of a head man, for in them was the place to
demonstrate the power to lead. Great deeds in social and ceremonial
life would alone elevate one to the status of a head man, though as a rule
the warpath was the line of least resistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These head men of uncertain tenure come to regard one or two of their
number as leaders, or chiefs. Such chiefs rarely venture to act without
the advice of some head men, as to stand alone would be next to fatal. In
tribal assemblies, the head men of the bands usually look to one of these
as spokesman, and speak of him as their chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the tenure and identity of a head man is thus somewhat vague,
his functions are rather definite. He is the guardian and defender of the
social order in its broadest sense. Of this, he is fully conscious; as, for
example, no man of importance will accept an invitation to visit for a time
in a distant band or tribe without calling a consultation. Should some
head men of his band indicate disapproval, the invitations will be declined.
The theory is that the welfare of his band is endangered by his absence.
Above all, the head men are expected to preserve the peace. Should a dispute
arise in which members of their band are concerned, one or more of
them are expected to step in as arbitrators or even as police officials if the
occasion demand. When it is suspicioned that a man contemplates a crime
or the taking of personal vengeance some head men go to his tipi and talk
with him, endeavoring to calm him, giving much kind advice as to the proper
course for the good of all concerned. If he has been wronged, they often
plead for mercy toward his enemy. Again, the head men may be appealed
to for redress against a fellow member of the band. In the adjustment of
such cases the head men proceed by tact, persuasion, and extreme deliberation.
They restrain the young men, as much as possible, after the same
method. In all such functions, they are expected to succeed without resort
to violence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For mild persistent misconduct, a method of formal ridicule is sometimes
practised. When the offender has failed to take hints and suggestions,
the head men may take formal notice and decide to resort to discipline.
Some evening when all are in their tipis, a head man will call out to a
neighbor asking if he has observed the conduct of Mr. A. This starts a
general conversation between the many tipis, in which all the grotesque and
hideous features of Mr. A’s acts are held up to general ridicule amid shrieks
of laughter, the grilling continuing until far into the night. The mortification
of the victim is extreme and usually drives him into temporary exile
or, as formerly, upon the warpath to do desperate deeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When there is trouble between members of different bands, the head men
of each endeavor to bring about a settlement. Thus, if one of the contending
party is killed, the band of the deceased sends notice to the murderer’s
band that a payment must be made. In the meantime, the murderer may
have called upon a head man of his own band to explain the deed. The
head men then discuss the matter and advise that horses and other property
be sent over to the injured band at once. A crier goes about with the order
and members of the band contribute.<a id='r27'/><a href='#f27' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[27]</span></sup></a> This offer may be refused by the
injured band and a demand made for the culprit’s life. No matter how
revolting the offence, the band is reluctant to give up the accused without
a fight. If no presents are sent in a reasonable time, the injured band
assembles in force and marches out. A head man meets them for a conference,
but a fight is likely. After a conflict of this kind, the band killing the
greatest number moves to a distant part of the country and when the camp
circle is formed keeps in sight but far out to one side. This separation may
continue for a year or more. In all such disputes between bands, the head
men of other bands may step in to preserve the peace; but, according to
report, they seldom accomplish anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking the Piegan, Blood, and Blackfoot as tribes, we may say that
there was a head chief for each. His office was more definite than that of a
band chief, though he was not formally elected. All the head men of the
various tribes came by degrees to unanimity as to who would succeed the
living chief, though the matter was rarely discussed in formal council.
The main function of the tribal chief was to call councils, he having some
discretion as to who should be invited. Some writers claim the Blackfoot
appointed two chiefs, one for peace and one for war; but we could find no
evidence for this, except that some band chiefs came to have special reputations
for ability as war leaders and were likely to be called upon in time
of need. They were not, however, regarded as head chiefs. While the
office of head chief was not hereditary, there was a natural desire among
the chief’s band to retain the office; thus it is said that among the Piegan
most of them have been members of the Fat-roasters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything of importance was settled in council. While each band was
represented there was no fixed membership; yet the head chief usually
invited those in excess of one member for each band. There seems to have
been no formal legislation and no provisions for voting. In former times,
the council was rarely convened except in summer. At the end of the fall
hunt, the bands separated for the winter to assemble again in the spring at
some appointed place. Even in summer they would often camp in two
or three bodies, each one under the leadership of some able-bodied band
chief, coming together for the sun dance at which time only the whole
tribal government was in existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The organized men’s societies among the Blackfoot were, when in large
camps, subject to the orders of the head chief or executive of the council
and on such occasions seem to have exercised the functions of the head men
of the respective bands. This subject will be taken up under another head,
but it is a matter of some interest to note how, when such camps were formed,
the head men of the bands were merged into a council for the whole and the
men’s societies became their executive and police agents under the direction
of the head chief. Thus, when there was danger, certain societies were
detailed to guard duty, especially at night. As the chief aim of an organized
summer camp was to hunt buffalo and the success of a general hunt depended
upon successful co-operation, the discipline was devised to that end. The
head chief gave out orders for making and breaking camp, and rules and
punishments were announced. Thus, a man found running buffalo or riding
about outside without orders might have his clothes torn off, be deprived
of his arms, his horse’s ears and tail cropped. Should he resist, he might
be quirted and his hair cropped. His tipi and personal property might be
destroyed. However, these were extreme punishments, it being regarded
as best to get along by persuading the would-be wrong-doer to desist. The
punishment inflicted by the members of societies were not personally resented,
as they were acting entirely within their rights. As to whether the
men’s societies were police by virtue of their own membership, or whether
they were individually called out to form an independent body is not certain,
but will be discussed elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long time ago Nathaniel J. Wyeth<a id='r28'/><a href='#f28' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[28]</span></sup></a> set down some interesting theories
concerning the economic reasons for the unorganized state of the Shoshone
in contrast to the buffalo-hunting horsemen of the Plains. He doubtless
sensed a truth in so far as the camp organization of the Plains is considered
as a type of government having for its chief function the supervision and
conservation of their immediate resources. Perhaps of all cultural phases
in this area, the one most often detailed in the older literature is the organization
and control of the camp when pursuing buffalo. So far as we have
read, the accounts for the different tribes are strikingly identical and agree
with the data from the Blackfoot. In most every case, the horse, the tipi,
the camp circle, and the soldier-band police were present, even though the
participants, when at home lived in houses and cultivated corn. That the
camp circle, or band circle, is a special type of tribal political organization
in this area seems obvious. It would be suggestive to know just how some
of the tribes having clan organizations adjusted themselves to this scheme
when using the circle.<a id='r29'/><a href='#f29' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[29]</span></sup></a></p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch14'><span class='sc'>Property Rights.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When a man dies his property is raided by the relatives. The older
sons usually take the bulk but must make some concessions to all concerned.
If the children are young, the father’s relatives take the property. In any
event, nothing goes to the widow. She may, however, retain her own
personal property to the extent of that brought with her at marriage. She
may claim, though not always with success, the offspring of her own horses.
These are horses given her by her relatives and friends. Though not clearly
thought out, the feeling seems to be that as the widow returns to her band
she is entitled to take only such property as she brought with her at marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the death of a wife, her personal property is regarded as due her
relatives, and may go to her daughters, if grown, otherwise back to her band.
Theoretically, at least, the woman owned the tipi, the travois, the horse she
rode, her domestic implements and clothing. Even to-day, when the white
conception of property tends to dominate, a man seldom speaks when his
wife bargains away her own hand-work, bedding, and house furnishings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Formerly, disputes concerning property were taken to the head men
for adjustment: now the settlements of estates go to the authorized Indian
court. Property was bequeathed by a verbal will. A man would state
before witnesses and his relatives what horses and property were to go to the
wife, to the children, etc. At present, written wills are sometimes executed
to protect the family. Under the old régime, the relatives sometimes disregarded
the wishes of the deceased and left nothing for the widow and
children; but, if a woman of good character with many relatives, she was
seldom imposed upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the division of meat from a co-operative hunt, the best cuts went to the
chief, the medicine men, and the owners of medicine pipes. This is somewhat
at variance with the usual democratic way of doing things and bears a
striking resemblance to a similar custom among the Western Cree. In an
individual hunt anyone approaching a man engaged in butchering was given
meat, sometimes even the last piece. However, he was certain of being invited
later to eat.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch15'><span class='sc'>Division of Labor.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The women dress the skins, make their own clothes and most of those
used by men. They make most of their own utensils: the tipi, the travois,
the riding-gear, prepare and cook the food, gather the vegetables and berries,
and carry the wood and water. As the greater part of the baggage, when
travelling, is their property, they bear the burden of its transportation.
It is a disgrace both to himself and his women, for a man to carry wood
or water, to put up a tipi, to use a travois, to cook food when at home and
above all to own food or provisions.<a id='r30'/><a href='#f30' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[30]</span></sup></a> While the men usually did the butchering,
the meat on arriving at the tipi became the property of the women.
A young man may cook food but in seclusion. There is a pretty tale of a
young fellow surprised by his sweetheart while cooking meat. He threw
the hot meat into the bed and lay upon it. The girl embraced him and
fondled him while the meat burned deeply into his body; but he did not
wince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the tipi, a man seldom rises to get a drink of water but calls on the
women to hand it to him. The men often make their own ornaments and
sometimes their leggings and coats. The painted designs upon men’s
robes and upon tipis are made by men; those upon parfleche and bags are
by women.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch16'><span class='sc'>Birth Customs.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>As the period of pregnancy nears its end the women discard their
bracelets and most of their metal ornaments. They dress in old clothes
and affect carelessness of person. Should a person look fixedly at one, she
will say, “Don’t. My child will look like you; you are ugly,” etc. As
the hour approaches, they retire to an isolated tipi where they are attended
by other women, men not being admitted. A medicine woman may be
called, who usually administers decoctions for internal use, supposed to
facilitate delivery. For bearing down, the patient holds to a pole of the
tipi, an attendant grasping her around the waist. When delivered she is
laced up with a piece of skin or rawhide as a support. She is then required
to walk or creep about in the tipi for a while instead of resting quietly, in
the belief that recovery will be hastened thereby. The after-birth is thrown
away and not placed in a tree as among the Dakota.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men should not approach the birthplace for a period as their medicine
and war powers would be weakened thereby. The father may enter but
at some risk. It is bad luck for men to step upon the clothing of the newly
born or touch those of the mother; lameness and other disorders of the feet
and limbs will surely follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Birth marks are regarded as evidences of re-birth. Boys so marked are
believed to be returned warriors bearing honorable scars. Twins are neither
regarded with suspicion nor especially favored. What data we have seem
to be against infanticide even in the case of great deformities. Tales
emphasizing the enormity of the crime are told of mothers to whom suspicion
attributed the death of such unfortunates. The still-born, it is
believed, will be born again.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch17'><span class='sc'>Menstrual Customs.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There is no special taboo upon a menstruating woman requiring her to
live apart but she is not supposed to come near the sick. The belief is
that in such a case something would strike the patient “like a bullet and
make him worse.” Further, at this time, women are supposed to keep away
from places where medicines are at work. These restrictions also apply
to immediate associations with men and to women lax in virtue.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch18'><span class='sc'>Care and Training of Children.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Large families seem not to have been unusual though I have never seen
many children with one woman. Some old men now living claim to be
fathers of more than twenty children each, though not by a single mother.<a id='r31'/><a href='#f31' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[31]</span></sup></a>
The young children, at least, receive considerable attention and some
discipline. They are sometimes punished by a dash of cold water or a
forced plunge. In former times, some old men were charged with responsibility
for each boy’s morning bath in the stream regardless of temperature;
hence, children were admonished that these men would get them. Striking
a child is not regarded as proper. The favorite boggie is the coyote, or the
wolf. Women will say, “Now, there is a coyote around: he will get you.”
Sometimes they say, “Come on wolf and bite this baby.” Such words often
compose lullabies, a favorite one being, “Come, old woman, with your
meat pounder smash this baby’s head.” After the use of intoxicants became
general, children were threatened with a drunken man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the first, children are taught to respect all the taboos of the medicine
bundles owned by the family and those of their relations and guests.
Girls are taught to be kind and helpful, to be always willing to lend a hand,
to be virtuous and later, to respect their marriage vows. Special stress is
laid upon virtue as a “fast” girl is a disgrace to all her relatives. All children
are expected to retire early and rise early. They must respect the
words and acts of the aged and not talk back to elderly people. They are
taught to take “joking” gracefully and without show of temper. All
“tongue-lashing” is to be taken quietly, without retort. Should a child
be struck by his equal, to retaliate in kind is proper. All requests for service
or errands made by elders, are to be rendered at once and in silence.
The ideal is the child that starts to perform the service before it is asked; or,
if asked, before the last word of the speaker is uttered. Talkativeness is
almost a crime in the presence of elders. The ideal is he who sits quietly
while the adults talk. If he is teased, he may smile but not speak. Above
all, when grown up, he should be self-controlled as well as firm and brave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boys were taught to care for the horses and to herd them by day: girls
to carry wood and water and to assist with other children and household
duties. Before marriage, girls must be proficient in the dressing of skins,
the making of garments, and the preparation of food. About the time of
puberty, boys are expected to go to war. Singly or in pairs they may get
permission to accompany a war party, provided they have shown efficiency
in hunting. At such times, they receive new names, as previously stated.
While the boy is expected to go to war, his family not only uses persuasion
to keep him at home, but often forbids his going. In any event, he gets
permission or goes secretly. It is said, that in this way the virtue of both
parents and sons is shown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We failed to find definite evidences of puberty ceremonies aside from the
boy’s change of name. Certain other small ceremonies may be noted.
Often when a child takes its first step or speaks its first word, the parents
are adroitly reminded that it is their duty to do something. Then they give
out presents or make a feast to which all the relatives contribute. Ear-piercing
is also somewhat of a ceremony and may be accompanied by a
display of wealth, except when performed at the sun dance. An old woman
is called for this service and, in imitation of a warrior counting coup, calls
out just before piercing an ear, “I have made a tipi, worked a robe, etc.,
with these hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If a person dies in a house it is abandoned, or afterwards torn down and
erected elsewhere, as the Blackfoot believe the ghost of the deceased haunts
the spot. Should a young child die, the house will be abandoned for a time
only. In former times, the tipi was abandoned or used as a burial-tipi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When all hope for the patient is abandoned, he is painted and dressed
in his best costume and, at present, often taken out of the house to a tipi
so that it may not be necessary to tear down the building. After death the
body is wrapped in a blanket, formerly in a robe, and buried within a few
hours.<a id='r32'/><a href='#f32' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[32]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>In recent years, the Indians have been forced to use coffins and to
practise interment. These are placed upon high hills and barely covered
with earth and stones. No effort is made to mark the spot and fear keeps
all the mourners far from the place. Indeed, it is difficult to persuade any
one to go near a known burial site. Some distinguished chiefs rest in houses
built on lonely hills. In former times, tree burial was common but now
rare, only one example having come under our observation. A person of
some importance was placed in a tipi on some high place. The edges of the
tipi cover were often weighted down with stones, circles of which are often
met with on elevated positions. Persons usually make requests of their
families that certain personal belongings are to be buried with them. Sometimes
the request is for a horse; in this event, one will be killed at the burial
place. It was quite usual for the tail and mane of a man’s favorite horse
to be cut at his death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At death, or its announcement, there is great wailing among the women,
who gash their legs and often their arms. Their hair is cut short, a practice
often followed by the men. Such hair should be thrown away and not
handled or used for any practical purpose. Women may wear a single
bead over one ankle for a time. In former times, a man would take to the
warpath and go along indifferently, neither seeking enemies nor avoiding
them if encountered. At present, they go on a long visit to some distant
relative. If a man owning an important medicine bundle loses a dear relative
he may be moved to cast it into the fire or otherwise desecrate it because
of its failure to prevent death; hence, a person once owning such a bundle
takes it away at once. After a time, medicine men approach the mourner
with suggestions that it is well to take up the care of his bundle now. When
he consents, a sweat house is made and after the ceremony, the mourner is
painted and newly dressed. The medicine bundle is then brought into his
tipi and he resumes his former functions. While the preceding is the normal
order of events, men have been known to destroy medicine bundles in the
face of great opposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the mourning period—an indefinite time—the man may dress
in the meanest possible clothes, neglect his hair and person, and live in a
small dilapidated tipi. However, there seems to be less formality in this
than among the Dakota, and the spectacular abandonment of the mourning
state often observed among the Teton is wanting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection, may be mentioned a practice not unlike “running
a-mok,” though apparently without mania. A man realizing that he is the
victim of an incurable disease may with more or less deliberation arm himself
and attempt the life of all persons he may meet. He will announce that
as he must die, he expects to take as many with him as possible. The records
of the reservations will show a number of killings brought about in this way.
Thus, a man took his wife out to a small hill, shot her and took his stand
against his pursuers, whom he held at bay to his last cartridge with which he,
though badly wounded, took his own life. An attempt of this kind came
under the observation of the writer while camping with a Blood band. A
young man suffering from consumption, slightly intoxicated and threatened
with arrest for disorderly conduct, announced to his family one night
that he expected to kill all of them and as many of the camp as possible.
Fortunately, while he attacked his wife with a knife, his rifle was spirited
away and the camp aroused; yet, as he kept out of reach, it was necessary
to hold him off with guns until dawn, when he fled in terror of capture alive.
Many officials attribute such outbreaks entirely to intoxication, but the
evidence we have gathered indicates that there is a conventional side to
the practice and a strong probability that it is a variant, and in some
respects a survival, of taking to the warpath. Officials and many Indians,
respect the convention to such an extent that every effort is made to prevent
persons fatally afflicted becoming aware of the fact until near the hour of
death. The writer found a similar practice among the Teton, though it
seemed that one life is regarded as sufficient, the doomed man usually taking
his own life after a short interval.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch20'><span class='sc'>Tales of Adventure.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Many Blackfoot men now but a half-century old took part in raids and
fights, or went on the warpath, so that now, as of old, deeds of war are
important social assets. In former times, only men of great deeds were
called upon to perform certain public and ceremonial functions, a custom
still in force but naturally less binding. While there are other social
ideals, such as owning important medicines, becoming a head man and possessing
wealth, that of being a successful warrior can scarcely be over-estimated.
The tale of adventure as told by the chief actor is the delight
of the fireside and entrances old and young alike when delivered by a skilful
narrator. Other tales, those of tradition and hearsay, are seldom
offered as it is the custom for one to narrate his own experiences, a rather
high ideal of truthfulness being entertained. Of course, there are historical
traditions, but they are usually given in brief without much life. Adventures
with animals and of the hunt have a place, but are of far less social
significance. The following is offered as a type of war narrative and also
because it gives a very clear picture of just how an expedition for plunder
was conducted. It was narrated by Strangle Wolf, a very old man, and
recorded by Mr. Duvall.</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the fall of the year. I was living with Lazy Boy, for he was an uncle
of mine. Lazy Boy was one of the chiefs of the Blackfoot Indians. In the evening,
Lazy Boy said to me, “Strangle Wolf, we will go out for some Assiniboine horses.”
This meant, of course, to steal them. “I have plenty of extra pairs of moccasins.
We shall need them, for we are going to travel on foot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow, Lazy Boy’s father-in-law, Heavy Shield, heard of this, came over that
night, and said to him, “Lazy Boy, you must not go this time. You can come over
in the morning and take my best horses; I don’t want you to go. I have had bad
dreams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the old man returned to his lodge. Lazy Boy only laughed and said to his
wife: “Go tell your father that I won’t listen to him this time. I must go and get
some horses to give him, for the Indians never give him any even when they have
many. Another thing is that I have my party ready and will start in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning, we all started. There were thirty of us in the party. Lazy Boy
was the leader. He was noted as a fast walker, and asked me to take the lead with
him. Lazy Boy fell to telling me about things he said I ought to learn. He said,
“Whenever you are out with a war party, as we are now, and all are on foot, you
should keep close to the leader, for if you hang back at the tail end you will always
be in a trot to keep up with the others; but if you are in the lead you can keep the
gait and not become tired so soon.” Another thing he said to me was, “When we
get to the Assiniboine camps, you must try to get the horses tied close to the lodges
for they are the best horses. The Assiniboine always keep up their best horses at
night while they drive the others out to the hills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went down the Missouri River. The game was plentiful. Buffalo and elk
we saw on our way, so we did not go hungry. Everyone had a little pack of meat on
his back and his extra pairs of moccasins. When the sun went down we camped for
the night. We made three lodges with sticks and bark. After we had cooked and
eaten some meat, the chief said we must sing the wolf songs. These songs are supposed
to give us good luck, on a trip, i. e., if we truthfully tell what our sweethearts
said when we left them. Each man is supposed to sing a song in which are a few
words his sweetheart said to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After we got through singing, all went to sleep. In the morning, we all started
out again. When the sun was high, we saw something a long way off resembling a
person. The Chief said, “It must be an Assiniboine. We must go after him and
kill him.” So we all ran toward him, and as we approached he seemed to be making
signs to us. When we got up to it, we found out that it was a black stump with its
black branches sticking out like arms. As we all went on, I heard some of the men
say that it was a bad sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We travelled many days and nights, until we came to a lot of timber along the
river. It was snowing and very cold. The Chief always kept two men ahead to look
over the tops of the high hills, so that we would not run into some of the Assiniboine
that might be waiting for us. At this place we all stopped and the chief called out
to two men, “You go across the river to see if you can find out just where the Assiniboine
camps are. We must be close to them now. We will wait for you here.”
The two men took off their clothes, tied their leggings and shirts around their heads
so as to be able to put them on dry when they got across. The river was wide and
deep and the two men swam across. We all waited. When the sun was getting
down close to the mountains, Chief Lazy Boy said to one of the men, “Why can we
not cross and wait for them there? It is too cold for the two men to swim back again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So we all got a few poles, tied them together and put a rawhide on top of them.
Then we put our clothes and guns on top of that. Then four men tied ropes to the
raft and taking the ends of the ropes in their mouths swam across. When we all
got across the chief said, “Although we are very cold we must not make a fire, for
we are close to the camps. They would see the smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had just gone down when the two scouts came back, saying to the chief,
“We saw two men leading their horses down to the river. Their horses were loaded
with meat, so the camps cannot be far off.” We waited here a long time until it
stopped snowing. The moon was shining brightly. A little later on we heard dogs
barking. It was nearly morning when the Chief said, “Come, let us go, it is nearly
daylight.” All went on until the Chief stopped, when we all stopped beside him.
He took a stick and, beating time with it on the barrel of his gun, sang his war song,
looking up at the moon. Once he used the following words: “Elk woman, try your
best.” When the Chief had finished, the others in turn sang their war songs. Then
we all started again. After we got close to the camps the Chief told me to go back
and tell two of the men to come with him, but for me to stay back with the others.
He said, “We shall go through the camp to find out where the best horses are. Then
we shall come back to inform you, and then we can all go together.” I told the two
men and they went off with him, while the rest of us stayed in the brush. About
daybreak, we heard a sound as if someone were riding along. Some of the men
said it was a loose horse. One of the men went out to look for signs of our party.
At the time the chief left us, four men from our party followed him. Thus there
were seven. It is believed to be unlucky when there are only seven in a war party.
Any way, it proved to be at this time. It was just daylight when we heard three
shots, and at the same time the men who went out came back to us saying, “You
said that was a loose horse we heard, here is what its rider lost.” He carried a gun-sack,
ramrod, and a saddle blanket. We all got up and ran up the river as fast as we
could. We had not gone far when we heard more shooting, war whoops, and galloping
horses. We kept on until we got to a place where there was thick timber. We
stayed there all day. We heard no more noise for we were now too far away. When
night came we all crossed the river and travelled part of the night until we came to
one of our old camping places. Our brush lodges were still there. We had planned
to meet there after we got our horses. We saw a light in one of them and when we
went in we saw one of the men who was with our Chief. He got up, shook hands
with us all, and then began to tell about it. He said, “When we all got near the
camps, we met an Assiniboine who ran back into the camp. Then we started back
to where we had left you. We had not gone far before we heard three shots. We did
not go fast, but when we got to where we had left you we saw that you were gone.
Then the chief said that you must have crossed the river. So we began to cross too.
We were just about in the middle, when the Assiniboine came upon us, and began
to fire. When we got across a number of the enemy were there for their horses could
swim faster than we and of course they headed us off. Then we had a fight. There
were only three guns for us to fight with for while we were crossing four of the men
lost their guns in the water. Two of our men were killed at the beginning of the fight.
Our Chief kept encouraging us saying that we must fight and die bravely for some
day our people would hear of our sad end. All this time dirt was flying around us
where the bullets struck. The smoke of the guns was like a fog a little above our
heads. The Chief was shooting and talking to the Assiniboine, telling them that
many of them would fall before the last of us. We kept them away as much as we
could, but sometimes they would try to run us down with their horses. After we
wounded several of them, they kept at a distance. When the sun was getting close
to the mountains, our Chief was killed. Our ammunition was nearly all gone.
There was a loose horse near by. I jumped on him and rode away. Then the
Assiniboine took after me. When I got to some thick brush, I jumped off the horse
and ran into the brush. They took the horse and went back. Then I came on
afoot. That is how I come to be here with you now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all lay down to rest for the night and about daybreak started home. Just
then the other three men came along. They got away from the Assiniboine after
dark. We travelled on for many nights and days until we reached home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we got home we stopped on a hill near the camp, but did not sing the song
of victory. We gave the sad sign that three warriors had been killed. One of our
men stood out alone, took three robes and, while the people in the camp were watching,
threw them away one by one. Then the Indians all knew that three of our
party had been lost and came running out to meet us.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of a somewhat different character were the adventures of Many White
Horses as narrated a short time before his death:</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>The Piegan were in camp at Ft. Benton. Rations gave out, so they broke camp
about sundown and pitched again after dark near some brush. I planned to go on a
raid against the Flathead for horses. Next morning, a large party joined me and
we went on to High Wood where we met and camped with a white man and his
Indian wife. I traded my black and red blankets for his white ones. We followed
the south bank of the Missouri, the berries were ripe, game was plenty and fat and
the journey was pleasant. We followed up the Bear Tooth, or South Fork, where
the railroad runs now. When one day’s march from the Flathead country, a storm
came up, and beat the tall grass down flat. In jest, I said to Calf Necklace, “Let
us go on alone. I believe that when we get out the wind will go down.” Soon we
came to an open country and to a cliff. Looking over we saw a river and a Flathead
camp. We returned to tell our party but lost them. We could not trail them as the
grass was down. Then we gave the call for having seen an enemy. The party
answered and soon joined us. Then we made a medicine smoke and gave prayers
for success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have a war-bonnet with four songs. When transferred to me, my face was
painted and the songs taught. When near the enemy I go through this in the same
way. I painted my powder horn and bullet pouch. I carried two awls, mending
materials and extra moccasins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no moonlight that night. We walked down to the Flathead camp and
found some of them still awake. Nearly all were drunk and had not tied up their
horses. One horse, however, was tied to a tipi pole, a striped pinto. My party
scattered every one for himself. Some had guns, some bows. The horses were wild
so they were run up a hill into brush. The men now worked by twos and threes
driving five to ten horses each. After we got into the brush some were caught. I
mounted at last. I decided to follow the ridge of the mountain. The way was
rough and many of our horses got away. I went in the lead to pick the way. It
snowed and made going slow. At last we lost the way and stopped to rest and
repair moccasins. Soon the weather cleared and we found the top of the ridge
but the snow was very deep. It took us all the next day to reach the gap at Sun
River Pass. The next night we started down to the plains. Two of my men got
very tired and sleepy so we stopped to rest them. All lay down, but overslept
and awoke at dawn. When I awoke I called out and all jumped up scared. I was
angry with myself. Our horses were gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, it seems that when the Flathead discovered their loss, a party set out on
our trail. While we slept they passed near and camped far in advance in a little
valley. Our escape was certainly due to my songs and medicines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We found most of the horses and started on. As I learned afterwards, the
Flathead saw us going over a ridge. We watered our horses at Sun River and went
on. I went on ahead to look over a ridge. As I came back the party signalled
something wrong. They had found the tracks of the Flathead party. As we went
on we saw two antelope and stopped for one to pursue them. Then Calf called out,
“Flatheads are after us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They dashed out of a valley and killed one of us before we could mount and soon
after, another. Our party began a dash for home. It was funny to see one fellow’s
leggings slip down to his ankles and get tangled under his horse. My horse was
strong so I rode behind whipping the others. As the Flathead were good shots we
scattered some. I could hear our pursuers talk but not understand them. After a
while, I saw that their horses were very tired: so I directed our course over the tops
of the hills. As their horses soon gave out, they dismounted to rest. When out
of sight we turned back toward Sun River and hid in the brush. It seemed a very
long day. One of our party was wounded and some had lost their clothes. When
night came we started again. Some rode double so there would be blankets to cover
all. The next day we spent on the Teton; the next near Dupuyer, where we found
the old camp fires of our people. Finally we got home.</p>

</div>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch21'><span class='sc'>Heraldry and Picture Writing.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The term deed as used by us has the same social significance as coup,
a full discussion of which has been given by Grinnell.<a id='r33'/><a href='#f33' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[33]</span></sup></a> Without going into
details, it seems that among the Blackfoot, the capture of a weapon was the
coup, or deed, rather than the formal striking of the enemy, though such
was also taken into account. Our impression is, from what we have heard
in the field, that there was no such formal development of the coup practice
as among many other tribes. An old man relating his deeds seldom mentions
scalps but dwells upon the number of guns, horses, etc. captured;
whereas, according to our observation, a Dakota boasts of his wounds,
enemies slain and coups. However, heraldry was a prominent feature in
Blackfoot life. By this term, we mean those conventions by which deeds
are recorded and accredited, with their social privileges and responsibilities.
Anyone with such recognized deeds is likely to be called upon to name a
child, to perform special services in social functions as well as specific parts
of ritualistic ceremonies. In all cases of this kind the warrior comes forward
and in a loud voice states what deed or deeds he has performed and immediately
renders the required service. For this, he may receive presents unless
the occasion is one of special honor. In theory, at least, the formal announcement
is a kind of challenge for contradiction by any of the assembly in so
far that it implies the eligibility of him who makes it. Women do not
ordinarily perform such deeds but often recount the embroidering of robes,
their resistance of temptation, etc., when about to perform some ceremonial
function, a truly analogous practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As elsewhere, the graphic recording of deeds was chiefly by picture
writing, upon robes, back-walls and the outsides of tipis. A few might be
indicated upon leggings, but in general, garments were not considered the
place for such records. The outside and inside of the tipi were the conventional
places. Good examples of this are still to be seen. An unusual tipi
was collected by the writer in 1903, bearing several hundred figures, representing
sixty-six distinct deeds most of which were performed by seven
Piegan then living. The tipi was in reality one of the “painted lodges”
to be discussed under another head, but may be considered here merely as a
good example of picture writing and heraldry.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-1.jpg' alt='' id='illo-1' style='width:350px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 1 (50-4485). Section of a decorated Tipi.<a id='r34'/><a href='#f34' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[34]</span></sup></a></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the sketches, Fig. 1 is a small vertical section of the tipi cover. Its
entire circumference to about half the height is one continuous array of
sketches. From this series a number of typical groups were reassembled
in Fig. 2. Beginning at the top in Fig. 1, we have Bear Chief (a) on foot
surprised by Assiniboine Indians but he escaped; (b) Double Runner cut
loose four horses; (c) Double Runner captures a Gros Ventre boy; (d)
Double Runner and a companion encounter and kill two Gros Ventre, he
taking a lance from one; (e) even while a boy Double Runner picked up a
war-bonnet dropped by a fleeing Gros Ventre which in the system counts
as a deed; (f) as a man he has two adventures with Crow Indians, taking a
gun from one; (g) he, as leader, met five Flathead in a pit and killed them;
(h) a Cree took shelter in some cherry brush in a hole, but Big Nose went
in for him; (i) not completely shown, but representing a Cree Indian killed
while running off Piegan horses; (j) Double Runner, carrying a medicine
pipe, took a bow from a Gros Ventre and then killed him; (k) Double
Runner took a shield and a horse from a Crow tipi, a dog barked and he
was hotly pursued; (m) he killed two Gros Ventre and took two guns;
(n) he captured a Gros Ventre woman and a boy; (o) he took four mules.
From this sample, it will be noted that a great deal is left for the memory,
though a little practice will enable one to determine the character of the
exploit suggesting each drawing. Fig. 2 needs less comment as the technical
aspect of the work speaks for itself. The large man with a pipe is symbolic
of the vision in which this type of tipi had its inception and, hence, belongs
in a different category. The drawing was done by a number of individuals;
in some cases, by the hero of the exploits, but often by a young man under his
immediate direction. This is obvious in the varying degree in execution
and conventionality, the range of which is adequately shown in the sketches.
When considered as a system of recording deeds, it appears that much is
left to the whim of the artist, but that certain general modes of suggesting
common types of adventure are recognized and allowed to control the composition
to such an extent that even a stranger may interpret the sketches
with confidence. Of course, the function of such writing is to objectify
the formal re-counting of deeds, only such performances as are so recognized
and carry with them social and ceremonial values being considered worthy
of a place in the series.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the many examples collected, we selected the following more or
less conventionalized symbols:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-2.jpg' alt='' id='illo-2' style='width:350px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 2 (50-4485). Selected Figures from a decorated Tipi.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Wounds received or given are indicated by a black spot with a dash of
red for bleeding. Enemies killed, when not fully pictured, are represented
by a row of skeleton figures as in Fig. 3a, a form always used in heraldic
horse decorations. In the pictured form, death is often indicated by
three wounds—in the head, heart and thigh, Fig. 3b. A scalp taken is
symbolized by human hair and white weasel skin, except in painting when
the symbol is as in Fig. 3c.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-3.jpg' alt='' id='illo-3' style='width:350px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 3. Symbols used in War Records.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The capture of the enemies’ property, or a deed, is indicated by pictures
of the objects recognized as worth considering. While naturally, there is
difference of opinion, the following may be taken as the approximate list
of captures conferring ceremonial rights:—horses, guns, shields, lances,
bows and quivers, shot-pouches and powder horns, daggers, war-bonnets,
and all medicine objects. The following order or rank, was given by an
informant recognized by the Piegan as an authority in heraldry:—gun,
lance, bow, the enemy’s life, cutting a horse loose from a tipi, leading a war
party, acting as a scout, shields, war-bonnets, a medicine pipe, and driving
off loose horses. The most significant point is that while the life of an enemy
is fourth, the capture of his gun is first. When a man was seen to fall with a
gun, it was not unusual for one or more young men to rush boldly out to
snatch the prize. To ride up, jerk a gun from an enemy’s hand and get
away without injury to either party was the greatest deed possible. While
in picturing such deeds realistic forms are used, as the symbol for a shield
(Fig. 3d), they are often greatly conventionalized. Blankets, if counted,
are shown as rectangles with one or two cross lines for the stripes on most
trade blankets. Horses taken in open fight, when not pictured, are represented
by track symbols, Fig. 5d and under the sketch of a mule in Fig. 1.
The rectangular variant as found among many other tribes is not used as an
equivalent.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-4.jpg' alt='' id='illo-4' style='width:350px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig 4. Methods of recording the capture of Horses.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Stealing a horse tied up in the enemies’ camp is a deed of special importance
and naturally has a definite symbolism. This case is of some interest
here because we find among our collection practically all the steps between
the full pictured form and the bare symbol. Thus, we find drawings showing
the adventurer cutting loose horses picketed near the tipis, Fig. 4;
again, the cutting represented by a knife and a hand, the pickets alone
representing the horses so taken, and finally, a series of crossed lines. The
last is the simplest form but may be said to be an alternate with the preceding
one, some persons representing the picket stake one way, some the other.
The Hidatsa<a id='r35'/><a href='#f35' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[35]</span></sup></a> are reported to use the crossed lines for a coup and the Teton
use it as a rescue symbol (a coup saved from the enemy); hence, its substitution
in Blackfoot records for the more realistic form of picket stake may
have been due to suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A war party intrenched is indicated by a circle (Fig. 5c); sheltered in a
wind brake, by an open circle (Fig. 2). A camp may be represented by
a series of tripods, signs for tipis (Fig. 1).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two functions of the warpath are honored by distinct symbols; that of
leader and scout. The symbol for leader is shown in Fig. 5a and is given
once for each party led. In like manner, the sign in Fig. 5b indicates having
been detailed as a scout. The origin of these cannot be definitely traced,
but the second is said to be a diagrammatic representation of the course
taken by a scout with reference to the main body. Thus, the curve represents
the war party waiting and the zigzag line the course always taken by
the scout to conceal their true position. This seems probable, but no
rational theory for the origin of the leader’s sign was encountered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coup stick, striped like a barber’s pole, used by the Cheyenne,
seems not to have been known among the Blackfoot except its analogous
form in a boy’s game. The Dakota stick made by binding together two
long rods with spiral decorations and four pendants of feathers with scalp
locks was seen in the hands of an old man; he, however, frankly avowed
having made it in imitation of those seen by him when visiting the Assiniboine.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 5. Highly conventionalized symbols.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a general way, it appears that the Blackfoot show some individuality
in the conventions of picture writing. Some data we collected from the
Gros Ventre show many of the same forms, however, and in the absence
of good data from the Crow and other neighboring tribes, it may be that
this individuality is more apparent than real. On the other hand, the Blackfoot
make little use of such writing for the presentation of religious experiences
as is the case among many Central Algonkin tribes and to a much
less degree among the Dakota. While the Dakota have developed some
heraldic symbols as conventional as those just described by us, they have,
in addition, a very complex and highly developed feather symbolism, a
feature almost lacking among the Blackfoot. Yet, the latter showed a
tendency to use the white weasel skins for the same purpose. More than
this can scarcely be said until additional data are at hand.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 6. A sand Map showing the Course of a War Party.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection, it may be well to note that by a system of signs, a
war party left definite information for the guidance of stragglers or other
parties of their tribe on similar errands. On leaving a camp site, a willow
bent V-like was stuck in the ground, the apex in the direction taken; if
the distance to the next camping place was small, the angle was quite acute,
etc. Another sign, used chiefly on the trail, was the mark of a travois, or
two converging lines, the apex toward the direction taken. Indeed, the
twig is spoken of as a travois sign. Explicit directions were often left for a
second party by a kind of map marked in the sand or in bare earth. A
sketch by the writer from such a map made at his request is shown in Fig.
6. Two branches of a river are represented easily recognized by one having
a knowledge of the country. The travois marks indicate the direction of
movement. Pebbles painted black or pieces of charcoal mark the proposed
camping places, the number in each case indicating the length of stop.
Thus, the sketch would imply that the next camp would be one day’s journey
from the nearest river; whence, after a stay of two nights, they camped
one night on the nearest fork and two nights on the second. To indicate
that they were joined by a second party, the travois signs are used to denote
two paths converging on a camp site. A sketch giving more details is
shown in Fig. 7. By the travois signs leading to <span class='it'>a</span> we know that two parties
of Blackfoot combined and camped two nights, thence moved to a second
camp, <span class='it'>b</span>. While here, they met and fought enemies, indicated by two sticks
painted red. Between the two sticks are two bones (shoulder blades) upon
which the result of the engagement is pictured. Then the party moved on
to <span class='it'>d</span> where this sketch was left.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 7. Map recording a Battle.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>In cases where the stops were by day and travel by night, yellow pebbles
were used instead of black. Mountains were indicated by small heaps of
pebbles. Marks were often made on stones and other objects along the
trail. In case a peaceful meeting occurred, instead of the red painted sticks,
black ones were chewed on one end and tobacco tied on the other. The
practical value of all these marks is obvious. When a war party was over
due, search was made by following the trail whence from the signs its career
could be determined, even to the identity of the wounded or killed, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We did not gather much information as to signalling codes, though the
system seems to have been highly developed. When a war party returned
the members paused for a time upon a hill in sight of the camp until attention
to them was noted.<a id='r36'/><a href='#f36' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[36]</span></sup></a> Then, if a victory was won at small cost they sang
songs for a while and came to camp slowly. If the leader or an important
man was killed, a robe was held up on a stick and then dropped. If ordinary
men were killed, one of the party stepped aside and threw down a robe,
once for each. For a wounded leader, a robe was held aloft but not dropped.
They then entered the camp silently while the women began wailing and
performed the usual acts of mourning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as our information goes, the time of day was noted by the sun and
the night by the position of Ursa major, the Seven Stars. The year was
designated by the winter, each winter constituting a new year. Two divisions
or seasons were recognized; spring and autumn were regarded as originating
with the whites. Each season was considered as composed of moons;
the period during which the moon was invisible taken as the beginning of
another moon. We found little consistency in the nomenclature of moons,
our information implying that they were considered more by numerals than
by names. The tendency was to count the moons from about October,
the beginning of winter or the new year. Variation seems to have been
due to the fact that calendar counts were kept by a few individuals, usually
medicine men, who modified the system according to their own theories.
One man who kept a calendar gave the following list:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The references to Sunday are to the Christmas and July holidays of our
own calendar. The year is generally regarded as comprising fourteen moons
equally divided among the two seasons. As calendars were usually in the
keeping of men owning beaver bundles and the number seven was employed
in enumerating parts of their rituals, this division of the year into moons
may be a matter of convention rather than observation. They claim to
have reckoned twenty-six days to a moon. Some, however, assert that
thirty days were counted; but in this case the year could not have comprised
fourteen moons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From one man we secured a set of 179 sticks used for keeping track of
time. Red sticks were used for years. Another used a bag with two parts;
one faced with red, the other with blue. Fourteen pebbles were used to
mark the moons; each time the moon became invisible he moved a pebble
to the other side. Calendars, or winter counts, were kept by memory rather
than by sticks, or paintings. We get the impression, however, that there
was less interest in such records than among the Dakota and Kiowa. The
following is Elk-horn’s winter count, beginning about 1845:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>This calendar is given as a type and not for the value of its contents,
though it doubtless has its merits from that point of view. The narrator
was somewhat uncertain as to the order of many counts and made frequent
use of a set of improvised counting sticks. We asked him why in later
years the winter counts were designated chiefly by the deaths of the most
prominent men, to which he replied that since his people were confined
to the limits of the reservation nothing else happened worth remembering,
and further, that the count ended with the death of White-calf because there
were now no men living of sufficient worth to be honored with such mention.
From the human point of view we agreed with him in that the book should
be closed, for the old ways have all but gone. If we were interested in the
historical aspect of this account the dates could doubtless be checked by
certain specific references as Nos. 11, 22, 43, and 56.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For completeness, we add the winter count of Big-brave, covering a
span of sixty-one years, but not giving full representation to the later years.
Since reservation days, there is a general tendency among the older men to
fix their counts in units of residence at a given spot; i. e., “for five winters,
I lived on Two Medicine, then for eight winters on Cut Bank, etc.”:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall of the year, Gambler went on the warpath and was killed;
Piegan spent the winter on the Marias River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall of the year, Big-lake, chief of The-don’t-laugh band died;
Piegan wintered on the Marias River which was high and flooded their
camps. In the summer, they had a sun dance at Sweet Grass Hills; Bobtail-horse
was shot and killed; a woman was also killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves-big-lodge-camp-marks clubbed a Flathead but did not kill
him; in the summer, Piegan killed some Sioux on the Marias.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Black-tattoo became crazy; in the spring a man named Goose was
killed by Sioux; in the summer, Goose’s father went to war and killed some
Crow; some of the Crow escaped by letting themselves down a high cliff
with a rope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still-smoking was killed; the Piegan stole a sorrel race horse from
the Flathead. In the summer some Piegan were on the warpath south of
the Missouri River. They came to some white settlers and there saw a
Sioux Indian whom Last-bull killed with a club. The Sioux had been
visiting with the white men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall, the first treaty was made by the Government at the
mouth of Yellow River; there were seven different tribes there. That
winter, Mountain-chief spent on Belly River. One of his daughter’s clothes
caught fire and she was burnt to death. During the summer Mountain-chief
became ill with the hiccoughs which lasted some time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;This winter was called the slippery winter because there was so
much ice. In the summer Mountain-chief and his people went to Canada
and killed thirty Sioux.</p>

<p class='pindent'>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Piegan camped on Marias, and one by the name of Blood killed
a Flathead Indian. Lame-bull, a chief, was killed by falling from his horse
in the summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain-chief spent the winter on Milk River and found an extra
large buffalo dung which was about three feet across when measured. Chief
Big-snake was killed in the summer.</p>

was killed. The Piegan killed five Sioux who had a horn spoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Coward was killed by Crow Indians. In the summer, the
Piegan attacked the camps of the Gros Ventre and killed many of them;
also, some Piegan were killed while out hunting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assiniboine attacked Mountain-chiefs camps on Big River
in Canada, at night, but did not kill anyone. The Piegan fought with the
Gros Ventre in the summer and a Piegan, whose name was Half-breed, was
killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;Piegan had what was called red smallpox; in the summer they
attacked the Assiniboine’s seventy lodges and running them out captured the
lodges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;At Fort Benton, the Government gave the Piegan clothes, etc.;
the white man who issued the things to them went by the name of Blackhorse-owner.
At this place they also made peace with the Gros Ventre. In
the summer Little-dog was killed and the Piegan fought with a great number
of enemies, with the Crow, Assiniboine, and Gros Ventre who helped one
another in fighting the Piegan; but the Piegan overpowered or whipped
them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear-chief was killed south of the Missouri and the following summer
the Piegan killed Weasel-horse, a chief of the Blood.</p>

killed two Flathead near the Piegan camps; in the summer the Piegan
killed thirty Assiniboine who were picking gum off the pine trees.</p>

killing many old men, women, and children. Running-raven was wounded
by a Gros Ventre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Piegan fought with the Cree on Belly River in Canada and
killed one hundred of them. In the summer they had a big battle with the
Assiniboine and Big-brave and his horse were wounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Piegan, Red-old-man, was killed by the Gros Ventre near Bear
Paw Mountain while he was trying to steal some horses from them; Black-eagle,
a Piegan, killed an Assiniboine and his wife, in the summer.</p>

in the summer, White-man’s horse and his war party were nearly all killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;Calf-chief killed two Flathead Indians near the Piegan camps
while they were about to steal some horses. Black-eagle was killed by the
Northern Blackfoot in the summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agent issued hogs’ heads to the Piegan as rations; in the summer
Big-nose took four Assiniboine prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were plenty of buffalo and many Assiniboine came to visit
the Piegan. In the summer the agent, known as Wood, issued clothing, etc.,
and the Piegan made peace with the Crow at Sweet Grass Hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>27.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Piegan killed his wife who was a Sarcee woman; in the summer,
Chief Calf-chief died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>28.&nbsp;&nbsp;Open winter, there was no snow all winter; Big-buffalo-rock died
during the summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>29.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weasel-moccasin was killed by the Assiniboine; had a sun dance;
cattle tongues were first used for sun dance; Agency was moved down where
it now is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>30.&nbsp;&nbsp;Piegan moved and camped south of Missouri; in the summer the
soldiers brought the Piegan back to the Reservation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>31.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Piegan wintered south of the Missouri; Black-cheek was
killed by the Flathead. In the summer, the Piegan moved back to the
reservation and an Indian was accidentally shot by the Agency doctor
during the sun dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>38.&nbsp;&nbsp;White-dog, an Assiniboine, was killed by the Piegan; Big-brave
and many others lived on Birch Creek seven winters and summers.</p>

and summers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>61.&nbsp;&nbsp;Big-brave moved to Blacktail and has been living there ever since,
nineteen winters and summers he has lived there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though we failed to find among the Blackfoot such elaborate chronicles
as among the Dakota and Kiowa, what did come to hand were obviously
of the same type and suggest common origins. Further, we get the impression
that in details our material is more like the counts of the Kiowa than
the Dakota.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch23'><span class='sc'>Oaths.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The sun is called upon in the most solemn oaths. Thus, when women
get into a dispute one may take the other by the chin and say “Now, we
will talk to the sun. If what I say is not true, may I never live to put my
foot into another snow,” etc. A man may appeal to the earth but more
likely it is the sun, as, “The sun hears me,” etc. Men usually make oaths
over pipes. Thus, when a man tells an improbable story he may be asked
if he will smoke upon its truth. This refers to the mode of making formal
oaths. Often when laboring with a man to prevent him from taking the
life of another, the head-men and relatives induce him to take an oath that
he will not do the deed. A medicine man fills a pipe, paints the stem red
and addresses the sun as to the purpose of the ceremony about to be performed;
the one to take the oath then smokes the pipe which is considered
most binding. The same method is often used in pledging a man to mend
his evil ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is another method—something like an ordeal. The point of a
knife is held in the ashes at the fire and extended with the charge, “If you
say what is true, touch the point of this knife with your finger.” The
belief is that one will certainly be killed by a knife or other sharp instrument,
if swearing falsely.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch24'><span class='sc'>Etiquette.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>To discuss this subject in detail would be a matter of considerable interest
and doubtless of definite comparative value; but it is our intention to
note only such points as came readily to notice. Naturally, many points
mentioned under previous heads may be considered as bearing upon this
topic. On approaching the tipi of a stranger, it is proper for a man to pause
some distance away and call out to know if the head of the family is at home.
If he is out and there is no adult male to act instead, the visitor is upon such
information not expected to enter but may, of course, carry on a conversation
with the women on the outside. When one is acquainted, or where the
man is known to be within, he enters without ceremony and takes a place
to his right of the door. Should the entire side be unoccupied he moves up
to a place opposite the host; should it be occupied he takes the first vacant
place. However, a man’s status and age may make it incumbent upon
those seated to make a place appropriate to his rank.<a id='r37'/><a href='#f37' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[37]</span></sup></a> The fire is the dividing
point of the house: hence, to pass between a guest and the fire is very
impolite. Should a man of some importance be smoking, one must not
pass between him and the fire, he may, however, take the pipe in his hands
and pass between it and the smoker. As soon as a male guest enters, the
host begins to cut tobacco and fill a pipe, which when lighted is passed to
the guest, back to the host etc., until it has burned out. Women as guests
usually take places to the left by the wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are a great many observances that partake of taboo rather than
etiquette. These will be discussed elsewhere, but it is proper to respect
all the restrictions of your host’s medicine. The well-informed are expected
to know what bundles the host owns and, of course, the observances thereto.
Thus, the bear must not be named in a tipi when there are certain bundles,
guests seeing these bundles hung up there must act accordingly and designate
the bear, if at all, by some descriptive terms. Again many men have
individual restrictions of the same sort, all of which are to be respected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a breach to ask a leading question as to one’s personal medicine
or experiences. One may wear an object until it has attracted general
attention and though many are certain that it is a medicine object of interest,
they will not ask about it. It may, however, be hinted at and a desire
for information implied, but the approach must end there. On the other
hand, the owner may speak freely if he so choose. We found no reason
to believe that a man felt any great reluctance to speak of such things at
his own initiative or that he felt under special obligation not to do so:
it is the blunt asking for information that is offensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Food should be set before a guest. A visitor, if from a distance, should
receive presents from the host and his relatives. Even now, a Blackfoot
visiting one of the other divisions of his people, returns with horses and other
property. This is, however, a kind of exchange, since his relatives are
expected to do likewise when visited by those befriending him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jesting at the expense of a guest, provided he is not a distinguished man,
is regarded as proper. Oft-times very rude jokes are thus played upon
strangers. A show of timidity or resentment is sure to stimulate such acts.
The usual procedure is for a number of men to gather, some of whom begin
to make indecent remarks concerning the guest while the host and a few
others pretend to speak against such proposals. Further indignities may be
offered but the host prevents the affair from going too far. We mention
this extreme of jesting to emphasize the large place it plays in Blackfoot
social life. Notwithstanding all this, the victims whatever their rank,
are extremely sensitive to such jests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ownership of certain medicines may determine the seat. Thus, as guests, the
medicine pipe men are given a seat opposite the host and must give way to no one. Should
they go out for an interval, no one should occupy the seat. As the penalty will be disease,
we have here what may be considered a taboo.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch25'><span class='sc'>Amusements and Games.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In former times, there was a good deal of merriment in the Blackfoot
camps. We have just characterized some of the jokes often perpetrated
and may mention others strictly for amusement. One Piegan band was
noted for its pranks. One of their favorites was to annoy visitors by a
mock family row. The host would begin a quarrel with his wife and then
to fight. The neighbors would rush in and with mock indignation take the
woman’s part. The result was a general mêlée in which they took care to
fall upon the guest and wallow him about as much as possible without
serious injury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a rule, jokes were between band and band. Thus it is related that
one time a band drove off the horses of another and herded them in the
brush near by. Then they innocently offered to join the war party for
pursuit. When all was ready they suggested that they look in the brush
as the horses might have been overlooked. Again, a band dressed one of
their men in white man’s clothes and painted his face black. Then while
his confederates were at the camp of the victim band he came up and in
plain view caught two horses, going off slowly. The confederates were
careful to call attention to it. Some young men pursued but when they were
near the man took aim at them. So they hesitated. Finally, the thief
disappeared over a hill. Then he whipped up, returned by another route
and left the horses in their places again to the confusion of the pursuing
party on their return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such pranks afforded amusement to all and served to brighten the life
of the camps.<a id='r38'/><a href='#f38' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[38]</span></sup></a> While there were always a number of persons adept at
chaffing and pranks there seems to have been no clown or buffoon, not even
in ceremonies. There were, and are now, certain dances that may be
termed social in which there are features expressly for amusement, but as
these also contain ceremonial features they may be passed by at this writing.
Games, on the other hand, seem to have no ceremonial associations and may,
therefore, be considered under this head. We shall, however, make a
distinction between amusement and gambling. The first are indulged in
by children and youths, rarely by adults.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Children had a great many games similar to those of white children,
from whom they may have been learned. Among these are tag, hide-and-seek,
jumping the rope, stilt-walking, slings, tops, dolls, hobby-horses,
coasting, ball games, shooting contests, racing, and follow-the-leader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hobby-horse seems to have been peculiar to girls. A stick was
selected with a natural bend between two parallel ends. A miniature
saddle was sometimes placed in the crook and other trappings added. Girls
coasted on pieces of rawhide, squatting at the rear and holding up the front
with the hands. In summer, this contrivance was used in sliding down steep
hills and cut banks. Boys usually coasted by sitting on a kind of toboggan
made of buffalo ribs lashed to cross sticks, though they were not averse to
using the more comfortable rawhide sheet.<a id='r39'/><a href='#f39' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[39]</span></sup></a> Small boys often played at
owning, stealing and tending horses, using rude images of mud or selected
stones of appropriate form. When buffalo were represented, their foot-bones
were usually used. The buzzer of bone and the bull roarer were
known as children’s toys, but the winged bones of the Teton and the snow
snake were not recognized by our informants. A toy called “whizzing
bone,” has not been identified by us, but was described as a contrivance for
throwing. Some of our informants had seen the cup-and-ball, but rarely
among their own people.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Top was a favorite game for boys. The wooden top (Fig. 8) is usually
made of birch in the round and varies in length from 11 to 16 cm., in diameter
from 8 to 12 cm. The bark is removed entire or in sections and the heads
marked with nails or paint, partly for ornamentation
and partly for identification. The wood
must be well seasoned so as not to be heavy.
The whips have four buckskin lashes about 35
cm. in length and handles about 75 cm. long.
This game is played in soft snow, the object
being to determine who can drive his top over
the greatest distance without interrupting the
spinning. The usual stakes are buckskin whip strings and tops.</p>

<div class='figleft'>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 9 (50-6155g).<br/> A Stone Top.<br/> Length, 8 cm.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another top game is played upon smooth ice. The tops are water-worn
egg-shaped pebbles (Fig. 9) about 15 cm. in transverse diameter. The
whips are similar to the preceding except that bark strings are used as shown
in Fig. 10. This is a matter of economy since it is the belief that the rocks
and the ice wear out buckskin strings very quickly and while the bark strings
are also short lived they are easily replaced. In the game, the rocks are
set spinning by whipping and when at high speed are
driven together, the one that stops spinning first
loses. In this game, the players are in pairs.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 10 (50-6154a).<br/> Top Whip with Lashes<br/> of Bark. Length, 71 cm.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes these rock tops are used on hard snow.
A shallow trench is dug which the tops must cross
while spinning. A skillful player will whip his top
in such a way that it will jump the trench. However,
should it fail it may be whipped out or thrown
out by the hand; if it ceases to spin, the player loses.
The name for top games is approximately, “knocking
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another boy’s game is with balls of mud stuck
on the ends of willow rods about two meters long.
A swing of the rod will drive off such a ball with
great force. If such play becomes a contest, the aim
is to see who can throw the greatest distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are a number of arrow games. The collections
contain two sets. One bow (Fig. 11b) has a
peculiar decoration on the back, produced by cutting
away portions of the bark. The other bow (Fig.
11a) is of similar form but plain. The arrows are in
sets of six, of plain feathered shafts, about 75 cm.
long and slightly sharpened. One arrow with the
carved bow has a peculiar head (Fig. 11b). There
are also two grass targets as in Fig. 11a.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 11 <span class='it'>a</span> (50-6148 g, a), <span class='it'>b</span> (50-6147 a, c).<br/> Gaming Bows and Arrows. Length of Bow, 97 cm.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>One simple game is opened by a player shooting
an arrow into a bank of earth which in turn becomes
the target for all. The one placing an arrow nearest
the target arrow wins all the arrows shot in the round. In a more complicated
game one arrow is set up beside a bank and used as a target as
in the preceding. The boy making the best shot gathers up all the arrows
at the target and shoots them at the grass target (Fig. 11). Each arrow
striking this target is his, otherwise they revert to their owners. The grass
target must be held in the hand grasping the belly of the bow and the
arrow. By a swing of the arms it is tossed forward and upward and
must be hit while in the air to win.<a id='r40'/><a href='#f40' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[40]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Another game spoken of as the sliding arrows was in favor. No bow
was used, the so-called arrows being but straight slender sticks about 80
cm. long, neither sharpened nor feathered. The set in the collection contains
39 sticks, 28 of which are plain, 4 burned black at one end and 7
decorated with a spiral burned band. We have no information as to the
significance of these divisions. In the game the players take an equal
number of sticks. They are thrown by hand, poising them on a small heap
of earth. The player throwing the greatest distance, takes all the sticks
thrown. As in other games, the play continues until one has all the sticks.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 12 (50-6146). A Wooden Dart. Length, 90 cm.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The casting of wooden darts, or arrows, is another boys’ game of the
same general type. The set of darts in the collection contains twelve
willow sticks about a meter long and 1.8 cm. in diameter. Each stick is
sharpened at one end and split into quarters at the other, Fig. 12. These
darts are usually decorated and to some are attached tufts of horse hair.
In the game the darts are thrown from the hand. First one is cast into a
clump of bushes and the players in turn cast at it as a target. The last
throw wins the darts. The use of the hair tufts was explained as an aid to
the count; thus, if several darts fell about equally near the target dart, the
one whose hair tuft touched it was declared the winner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We secured vague accounts of another game in which arrows were shot
at a bundle of arrows, the best shot taking the bundle.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 13 (50-6165). The Wheel Game. Diameter, 41 cm.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The wheel game is played with a netted hoop, strictly for amusement,
by young people. The hoop in the collection is shown in Fig. 13.<a id='r41'/><a href='#f41' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[41]</span></sup></a> The
center mesh is called the navel and the open parts of the loops around the
hoop, the teeth. The darts are simple pointed sticks about 80 cm. long
without forks at the end as observed among some other tribes. Counts are
made when the darts pierce the navel or one of the teeth, according to any
value agreed upon by the players. Two persons are necessary to the game,
but there is no maximum limit to the number of players. The opposing
sides take up positions at fifty yards or more. A player rolls the wheel
toward the opposite side, its players casting darts at it as it passes. Should
a count be made the wheel is thrown back high in the air, the opposing side
attempting to catch it on their darts. Should they in turn make a count,
the wheel is thrown back to the other side, etc. For every failure to count,
the wheel is returned by rolling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A kind of shinny, called “batting ours,” was played by men, women and
youths. Bats of rough sticks with slightly curved ends were used (Fig. 14).
The balls are spherical, about the size of a base ball, composed of skin covers
stuffed with hair. The game is rough and frequently results in serious
injuries. The players are arrayed in two sides. Two lines, or goals, are
placed about 300 yards apart. The players group about the midway point
and the game is opened by tossing the ball into the air. Each side strives
to bat the ball over its own goal.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 14 (50-6149). A Shinny Stick. Length, 89 cm.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another ball game, known as the Cree Women, is played by adults and
youths. A ball is used similar to the preceding, but is tossed from hand to
hand. The players are in pairs. The game is opened by tossing the ball
into the air whence each player strives to recover it. The one who secures
it, then faces his partner and the ball is tossed back and forth. The other
players may use every means to disconcert them except actual physical
interference. When the ball is dropped all rush for it and the first to secure
it, plays with his partner as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wrestling was common among boys and young men. Formal bouts were
usually between two sides. The players sat facing in rows. One side put
forward a man with a challenge to the other. They put forward an opponent.
The victor was then the next challenger until thrown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rough game, known as kicking each other, was popular among young
men and boys; the usual way was to form two opposing lines and kick each
other to see which would give way. Another game, known as bear play,
was popular when swimming; boys would unite, seize a boy and toss him into
the deepest water, then scamper away. The victim pursued until a boy
was caught when, at once, the others joined in tossing him into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A children’s game, known as skunk, is a kind of round in which all
stand in line each with hands on the shoulders of his neighbor. The
leader carries a stick of wood, burning at the end, from which he beats
sparks with another stick. The row of children sing and dance without
breaking the line. The leader endeavors to come near the rear of the line
so that the sparks will fly upon the players, they in turn seek to avoid him
without breaking away. While this was a rough game, it was popular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boys often amused themselves by placing embers from the fire on a stone
and striking them with another stone. When skillfully done, this gives
off a report like a gun.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch26'><span class='sc'>Gambling.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Playing for stakes was always a favorite and the games to be described
here were rarely played except in gambling. Gambling is often spoken of
as fighting, or war, and in turn war is spoken of as gambling. This is
reflected in a myth where the players’ scalps were at stake.<a id='r42'/><a href='#f42' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[42]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='ch26a'></a><span class='it'>The Hand-Game.</span> Piaks kaiŏsin, approximately fancy gambling, was
in a way team work, sometimes as many as twenty-five men on a side, band
playing against band or even camp against camp. The outfit consists of
4 hiding sticks, or two pairs, 12 counters and a number of drumsticks for
beating time on lodge poles set up in front of the players. The pair of hiding
sticks are designated as the short and the long, though they are really
of equal length, the one called long being designated by a string wrapped
about its middle. They are about the thickness of an ordinary lead pencil
and about 7 cm. in length. The materials are wood or bone. The counters
are about 38 cm. long, of plain wood sharpened at one end for sticking up
in front of the players. The drumsticks are short clubs of no definite form.
Each side takes a pair of hiding sticks and selects a man to do the hiding
and one to do the guessing, according to their known skill. Each hiding
man, or leader, faces the guesser of the opposing side and the play begins.
The leaders put their hands behind them and then show their hands when
the guess is made. The side guessing correctly takes one counter and also
their opponents’ pair of hiding sticks. This opens the game. There are
now two leaders for the playing side. They confront the guessers of their
opponents. The player’s side now sings and drums upon the tipi poles,
provided for that purpose, apparently to divert the attention of the guessers.
For every failure of a guesser, the playing side takes a counting stick.
Should one of the leaders be guessed correctly, he gives his hiding stick to
his companion who plays with the four. If the guess is now wrong, he
takes one counter and restores a pair to his companion to play as before.
However, should the guess be correct, the playing side loses the hiding
sticks to their opponents. Thus the play continues until one side has the
12 counting sticks, or wins.<a id='r43'/><a href='#f43' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[43]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The songs have a definite rhythmic air but consist of nonsense syllables.
However, jibes and taunts are usually improvised to disconcert the guessers.
The game is very boisterous and, in a way social, but is never played except
for stakes of value, as horses, robes, guns, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Formerly, this game was often played by members of the All-Comrades
Societies, as the Braves against the Dogs, etc. In such cases the songs were
from their own rituals. The man handling the sticks was sometimes very
skilful in deceiving the guessers. To disconcert him, the opposing side
often counted coup on him. One would recount how he took a scalp, leap
upon the shoulder of the player, grasp his hair, flash a knife, etc., he, all
the while handling the sticks. They might pretend to capture his blanket
or repeat any other deeds they had done in war. The idea was that if the
deed counts were true, the re-counting of them would give power to overcome
the skill of the player. This made the game noisy and rough, but
quite exciting. The players were always skilful jugglers and regarded as
medicine men. The amount of property changing hands in such gambling
was truly astonishing, whole bands and societies sometimes being reduced
to absolute poverty and nakedness. Women may play the game but with
three counting sticks instead of twelve.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='ch26b'></a><span class='it'>The Wheel Gambling.</span> For this game, a small wheel about 7 cm. in
diameter is used. The form is precisely like that of the Gros Ventre shown
in Fig. 22, p. 188, Vol. I, of this series. There are two sets in the Blackfoot
collection one of which has six spokes, the other seven. The spokes are
distinguished by beads of different colors or combinations. For the game
a wheel and two arrows are required, there being but two players. The
arrows in the collection have metal points and are feathered. They are
about 85 cm. long. In playing the wheel is rolled by one of the players
toward an obstruction, usually a board, about 6 m. distant. The two follow
it closely and as it falls after striking the obstruction, try to thrust their
arrows under it. This must be done so that the wheel will fall upon them,
not cause its fall. The count is according to the position of the spokes
upon the arrows. The winner rolls the wheel, the advantage being always
with the one who does this. The counts are usually in multiples of five,
values being assigned to the various spokes by mutual agreement at the
opening of the game.<a id='r44'/><a href='#f44' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[44]</span></sup></a> Small pebbles are used as counters, or chips. The
betting is by pledging a blanket for so many pebbles, a knife for so many,

<p class='pindent'><a id='ch26c'></a><span class='it'>The Four-stick Game.</span> To the Blackfoot this is known as “travois
gambling,” and is played by women. A set in the collection was said to
be of buffalo bone (Fig. 15). The sticks were named six, two, and snakes;
though sometimes designated as twos and snakes, a pair of each. The
detail of the markings varied but followed the same general scheme in so
far that the snakes were always marked with the wave-like design. They
were cast upon the ground or a blanket. Since the opposite sides of the
sticks are blank there are eight faces. The usual count is as follows: zero
two blanks, one snake and <span class='it'>a</span> or <span class='it'>b</span>; 2, two blanks and two snakes; 4, four
blanks; or as they appear in the figure; 6, three blanks and six (b), or one
blank, two snakes and two (a); one blank, six (b) and two snakes counts
nothing but the player may pick up the stick called six and throw it
upon the others to turn them, counting according to the result. Other
combinations give no score. The player continues to throw so long as
the above combinations result; failing, the turn passes to the next. As
a rule, there are but two in the game.<a id='r45'/><a href='#f45' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[45]</span></sup></a> The number of points in a game
and the wagers are a matter of agreement between the players.<a id='r46'/><a href='#f46' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[46]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Certain games well-known to neighboring tribes were not recognized
by our informants as having been played by the Blackfoot. Among these
were the plum stone, or button dice, the moccasin game, the hoop game,
the 102 stick game, the cup-and-ball, the snow snake, ice-gliders, and winged
bones. Most of them had been seen, but in the hands of aliens. Odd-and-even
seems to have been known to the Northern Blackfoot, but was not
in favor.<a id='r47'/><a href='#f47' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[47]</span></sup></a> We have found no traces of ceremonial associations with these
games. While mention of the wheel games is made in several myths, this
seems purely circumstantial, except that the Twin-brothers are credited
with originating the netted wheel.<a id='r48'/><a href='#f48' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[48]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The small spoked wheel of the Blackfoot is practically identical with that
of the Gros Ventre. According to Culin, this beaded type has been observed
among the Crow, Nez Perce, Thompson and Shushwap tribes, suggesting
its origin, if not with the Blackfoot, at least, with some of their neighbors.
The particular form of button used in the Blackfoot hand-game seems to
belong to the west of the Rocky Mountains, to the coast and southward
in the plateaus. The beating upon a pole is found among the Nez Perce,
Kootenai and perhaps elsewhere. While the Gros Ventre had the Blackfoot
names “long and short,” their buttons and method of play were more
like those of the Arapaho. The stick dice (travois game) when rigidly compared
as to form and marking, bear close parallels among the Gros Ventre.
Hidatsa, and Chippeywan with less correspondence west of the Rockies.
On the other hand, the Blackfoot indifference to seed and button dice
tends to class them with western tribes. Neither the Blackfoot nor the
Gros Ventre seem to have used the large hoop and double darts of the
Dakota, Omaha, and Arapaho. Thus, in a general way, the Blackfoot fall
into an ill-defined group comprising tribes on the head-waters of the Missouri
and Columbia Rivers. They seem on the whole, to incline more
toward the Plateau and Shoshone area than to the Siouan or Algonkin.
Of greater interest, perhaps, is our failure to find any game associated with
the stalking of buffalo or any other ceremony. So far as we can see, all
games are to the Blackfoot either amusement or gambling and a résumé
of our account will show that many of the former also reflect the gambling
conception.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
